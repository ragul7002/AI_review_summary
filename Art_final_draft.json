  "abstract": "Here is an example:\nART (Articulated Reconstruction Transformer) is a feed-forward model designed to reconstruct complete 3D articulated objects from sparse, multi-state RGB images. The method treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. We introduce a category-agnostic, feed-forward model that can be trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset to achieve significant improvements over existing baselines and establish a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs. 1. Limitations. Our method assumes a known part count for the target object and relies on pre-calibrated camera poses. Future work should include learning a pose-free variant (self-calibrated cameras) with larger datasets and integrating part-count estimation directly into the model. 2. Experimental Results. We demonstrate that ART can reconstruct complete 3D articulated objects from diverse categories of images, achieving state-of-the-art results across benchmarks. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation.",

We introduce the ART model and demonstrate its effectiveness on diverse benchmarks using a large-scale dataset. Our results show that ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.\nThe paper is structured into several sections, including an introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. The introduction provides background information on the problem of articulated object reconstruction and outlines the key contributions of the study. The methodology section describes the ART model in detail, including its architecture, training data, and evaluation metrics. The results section demonstrates the effectiveness of the ART model on diverse benchmarks using a large-scale dataset. Finally, the discussion section analyzes the limitations of the method and discusses future work.\nThe paper is suitable for academic use as it contains detailed explanations of the methodology and results sections, as well as a thorough review of relevant literature. It also includes figures and tables to support the text.",
