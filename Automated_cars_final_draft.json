  "methodology": "Here is an example:\nArea Network (CAN) bus [1], for in-vehicle communications among its electrical subsystems, including the steering wheel, brake, and engine, each of which is monitored and controlled through an electronic control unit (ECU). Researchers managed to manifest concrete intrusions to ECUs of manned vehicle to cause a breakdown or trafﬁc accident [3]–[6]. Security is always critical for trafﬁc vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively detect intrusions to the in-vehicle communications of autonomous car. In an unmanned autonomous car, a self-driving model reads sensory information reflecting dynamic road contexts and generates control signals that are eventually transformed into frames transmitted on the CAN bus. The ever-changing control signals at runtime require the involvement of road contexts in detecting intrusions for autonomous car. We accordingly develop RAIDS. [1] T. Hoppe, S. Kiltz, and J.
