  "methods": "Berger [1] for domain wall motion and by Slonczewski [2] for\nspin-valves and multilayer structures. The unusual property of spin-transfer interaction found in Ref. 2 was the\ntendency of current induced torques to rotate magnetic\nmoments of both spin valve layers in the same direction,\nmuch like the oncoming wind rotates the wings of a windmill (Fig. 1). If one assumes that layers have no magnetic\nanisotropy (crystalline or shape), are identical, and there\nis no RKKY exchange or dipole-dipole interaction between them, the resulting motion is a perpetual rotation\nof magnetic moments m1 and m2 in clockwise or counterclockwise direction, depending on the direction of electric\ncurrent I passing through the spin valve. We will call this\ntype of motion a Slonczewski “windmill regime”.\nSince actual spin-transfer devices have significant magnetic shape anisotropy, normally the windmill regime is\nnot realized. Instead, switching between different preferred magnetic configurations was predicted [2] and is intensively studied since then both experimentally and theoretically. However, the windmill regime still constitutes\nan interesting problem due to the following.

Thus one\ncan hypothesize, that in response to a current pumped\nthrough the valve the magnetizations will tend to assume this minimal resistance configuration in order to\nmake electron flow easier. More generally, an idea arises\nthat a current passing through a metal with paramagnetic impurities will tend to orient them parallel and create some sort of current-induced ferromagnetism. [4,5] The\ntwo-magnet device is the minimal model where the validity of this idea can be tested. We study the behavior of\nsuch a device with arbitrary parameters, except for the",
  "results": "a generalized picture of the Slonczewski windmill regime,\nand shed some light on the possibility of current-induced\nferromagnetism.\nWe use the single domain approximation. The magnetic moments mi (i = 1, 2) of the layers have timeindependent absolute values mi and variable directions\ndefined by a unit vector ni(t). The LLG equations in\nterms of mi read [2,6]\nwhere Tex is the exchange torque, τ 1,2 are spin-transfer\ntorques, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and α1,2 are Gilbert\ndamping constants of the magnets. Note that in conventional experiments m2 is fixed by magnetic anisotropy,\nwhile m1 can rotate under the influence of spin-transfer\ntorque. Magnet number one is then called a “free layer”\nand magnet number two is called a “fixed layer”, or spin\npolarizer. In the present investigation no restrictions are\nimposed on m2 and both magnetic moments are treated\non equal footing.\nThe exchange torque acting on m1 is given by Tex =\nJ[m2×m1] (J > 0 corresponds to ferromagnetic coupling\nm˙ 1 = γ (Tex + τ 1) + [α][1]\n[m1 × ˙m1], (1)\nm1\nm˙ 2 = γ (−Tex + τ 2) + [α][2]\n[m2 × ˙m2], (2)\nm2\nbetween the moments). The exchange torque acting on\nm2 is −Tex since we are dealing with an internal interaction between two moments.\nThe spin-transfer torques τ 1,2 are given by\nτ˙ 1 = u1 · [n1 × [n2 × n1]], (3)\nτ˙ 2 = −u2 · [n2 × [n1 × n2]], (4)\nwith torque strengths\nI\nui = [¯][h] (5)\n2 e [g][i][[(][n][1][ ·][ n][2][)]][ .]\nHere I is the electric current flowing form magnet\n2 to magnet 1, e is the (negative) electron charge,\nand gi[(n1 · n2)] are material and device specific spinpolarization factors. For negligible spin-relaxation in\nthe non-magnetic spacer between the magnets one has\ng1 = g2 (see Ref. 2). Note that both u1,2 are positive\nwhen electrons flow from magnet 2 to magnet 1. The minus sign in front of the right hand side of Eq. (4) reflects\nthe symmetry of spin-transfer torque. [2]\nFirst, we rewrite Eqs. (1) and (2) so that time derivatives are on the left hand side only. Defining T1 =\nTex + τ 1, T2 = −Tex + τ 2, we get for i = 1, 2\n     (1 + α [2] i [) ˙][m][i][ =][ γ] Ti + [α][i]\n[α][i] [mi × Ti] .

Using Eq.

Since in both collinear states Tex = 0 and\nτ 1,2 = 0, the system will come to rest and no “windmill”\nmotion will happen. For small spin transfer torques u1,2\nthe final state will be determined by the sign of J and,\nas expected, the device will end up in a configuration\ncorresponding to the minimum of exchange energy.\nThe marginal case C = 0 is the only situation when\nthe “windmill” is possible. According to Eq. (9), the\nvalue of C linearly depends on electric current I through\nu1,2. The only exception is the singular case when device\nparameters satisfy g1/[(1 + α [2] 1 [)][m][1][] =][ g][2][/][[(1 +][ α][2] 2 [)][m][2][],]\nand C is current-independent. Thus in general one can\nachieve the windmill regime by tuning the current exactly\nto the “marginal” value Iw, such that C(Iw) = 0. Note\nthat this value corresponds to a spin transfer strength\nof uw ∼ αJm1m2, and since α ≪ 1 the required spin\ntorque is much smaller than the exchange torque. The\nsituation is similar to the switching regime, where spin\ntransfer effect works against the magnetic anisotropy. In\nboth cases critical values of spin torque are proportional\nto the small Gilbert damping coefficient.",
  "conclusion": "assumed J = 0, α1,2 = 0, and m1 = m2. It was found\nthat magnetic moments rotate in the plane spanned by\nvectors m1 and m2 at the initial moment, and the angle\nθ between them remains constant. How will the windmill\nmotion look in the general situation? At C = 0 the total\nmagnetic moment is conserved, M [2] = m [2] 1 [+][ m] 2 [2] [+ 2(][m][1][ ·]\nm2) = const, thus θ is constant in general case as well.\nSince magnitudes of m1 and m2 are also fixed, constant\nθ implies that both vectors will rotate with the same\nangular velocity,\nm˙ i = [ω × mi] (11)\n(cf. the theorem on the motion of a rigid body with a\nfixed point). To find ω we expand it in the basis of vectors\n(ν, m1, m2) as ω = aν + b1m1 + b2m2 with unknown\ncoefficients a and b1,2. Substituting this form of ω into\nEqs. (11), using expressions (7) for ˙mi, the fact that for\nthe marginal value of current one has B1 = −B2 ≡ Bw,\nand properties [ν × m1] = −l1, [ν × m2] = l2, we find\na = −Bw, b1 = A2, and b2 = A1\nω = Bw[m1 × m2] + A2m1 + A1m2 .

Thus vectors mi precess approximately around the total magnetic moment\nM = m1 + m2. In the presence of damping and spintransfer M is not conserved and performs a small angle\nrotation around the constant vector ω. In this respect\nthe motion is very different from Slonczewski’s situation\nat J = 0, where M was performing 360 [o] rotations around\n[m1 ×m2]. The J = 0 rotations, however, require the fulfillment of a condition g1/[(1+α [2] 1 [)][m][1][] =][ g][2][/][[(1+][α][2] 2 [)][m][2][],]\nwhich is, in particular, satisfied in a completely symmetric valve considered in Ref. 2.\nFinally, we return to Eq.

We conclude that as t →∞ the system approaches a collinear configuration with a current dependent characteristic time T∗(I). The latter diverges in the\nvicinity of the marginal current Iw.\nspin-transfer device with zero magnetic anisotropy. We\nshow that in the presence of damping, layer asymmetry,\nand exchange interaction between the layers the windmill\nrotation decays with characteristic time constant T∗. The\ndecay time depends on the current pumped through the\ndevice and diverges at a “marginal” current Iw. For I ̸=\nIw the system reaches either a parallel or an antiparallel\nstate after a transient period. Exactly at the marginal\npoint I = Iw the system performs a perpetual generalized\nwindmill motion.\nInterestingly, precession motion analogous to the windmill regime was also found in multilayers and bilayers\nwith magnetic anisotropy. [7,8] In those systems it exists\nnot at a singular point, but in the whole range of current values. Thus, rather unexpectedly, anisotropy can\nbe advantageous for the windmill regime.\nmagnets can be special, and it is necessary to consider\ndevices with three and more magnets to predict what\nhappens in the system of many isotropic paramagnetic\nimpurities under the influence of spin-transfer torques.\nAppl.
