The steep rise in greenhouse gas emissions\nsince the Industrial Revolution has increased the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere\nby about 30%. This is widely believed to be the dominant cause of the observed rise of\nabout 0.6◦C in the global mean surface temperature during this period [8].\nA small systematic rise or fall in the global temperature is caused by a net imbalance\n(“forcing”) in the Earth’s energy radiation budget. The radiative forcing caused by the\nincrease in the CO2 fraction since 1750 is estimated to be 1.5 Wm−2 (Fig. 1) [8], compared\nwith the global average incoming solar radiation1 of 342 Wm−2, i.e.",

Since the total power consumption of the experiment is under\n60 kW, the electricity costs are negligible.\n8.2\nTechnical coordination\nTechnical coordination covers the following tasks:\n• Establishment of a master schedule linked to each institute’s own schedule, and\nmonitoring of the progress.\n• Management of all interfaces between the various components, and resolution of any\ntechnical inconsistencies.\n• Management of the engineering data.\nConcerning the last item, all relevant documents (technical speciﬁcations, engineering\nand calculation notes, documents from manufacturers, etc.) would be organised within the\nframework of the CERN EDMS (Engineering Data Management System). In particular,\nthe CDD (CERN Drawings Directory) software will be used to provide a central library\nof all relevant drawings produced by the institutes or manufacturers. Once stored and\narchived in the CDD, the drawings are available to all registered collaborators through\na web interface.",
