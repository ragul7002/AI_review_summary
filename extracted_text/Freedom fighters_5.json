  "results": "First, we analyze the natural curve FF _v_ that develops when the fighter\nkeeps building, at speed _v_, a barrier along the boundary of the expanding\nfire. We prove that the behavior of this spiralling curve is governed by\na complex function ( _e_ _[wZ]_ _−_ _s Z_ ) _[−]_ [1], where _w_ and _s_ are real functions of\n_v_ . For _v > vc_ = 2 _._ 6144 _. . ._ all zeroes are complex conjugate pairs. If _φ_\ndenotes the complex argument of the conjugate pair nearest to the origin\nthen, by residue calculus, the fire fighter needs _Θ_ (1 _/φ_ ) rounds before the\nfire is contained. As _v_ decreases towards _vc_ these two zeroes merge into\na real one, so that argument _φ_ goes to 0. Thus, curve FF _v_ does not\ncontain the fire if the fighter moves at speed _v_ = _vc_ . (That speed _v > vc_\nis sufficient for containing the fire has been proposed before by Bressan\net al. [7], who constructed a sequence of logarithmic spiral segments that\nstay strictly away from the fire.)\nSecond, we show that any curve that visits the four coordinate half-axes\nin cyclic order, and in inreasing distances from the origin, needs speed\n_v >_ 1 _._ 618 _. . ._, the golden ratio, in order to contain the fire.\n**Keywords:** Motion Planning, Dynamic Environments, Spiralling strategies, Lower and upper bounds\namong them upper and lower bounds for the speed the fire fighter(s) need, and\nexistence theorems for solutions that contain the fire and minimize the area\nburned.\nA very interesting case has been studied in Bressan et al. [7]. A circular fire\ncentered at the origin spreads at unit speed, and a single fire fighter can build a\nbarrier at speed _v_ . Their construction is based on the following observation. Let\n_P_ be a point on the logarithmic spiral _S_ _[α]_ = ( _ϕ, e_ _[ϕ]_ [ cot] _[ α]_ ) of excentricity _α_, and\nlet _Q_ denote the next point on _S_ _[α]_ touched by a tangent at _P_ ; see Figure 1, (i).\nThen the spiral’s length to _Q_ is at most 2 _._ 6144 _. . ._ times the sum of its length\nFig. 1: (i) A logarithmic spiral _Sα_ of excentricity _α_ ; angle _ϕ_ ranges from _−∞_\nexpanding boundary.\n2\nto _P_ plus the length _|PQ|_ of the tangent, for all values of _α_ . In other words,\nif the fighter builds such a barrier at some speed _v > vc_ := 2 _._ 6144 _. . ._ she will\nalways reach _Q_ before the fire does, which crawls around the spiral’s outside to\npoint _P_ and then runs straight to _Q_ . In [7] the fighter uses this leeway to build a\nsequence of logarithmic spiral segments of increasing excentricities _αi_ that stay\naway from the fire, plus one final line segment that closes this barrier curve onto\nitself.\nLogarithmic spiral movements have also been used for shortest paths amidst\ngrowing circles [2,21] and in the context of search games [18].\nIn this paper we study the rather natural approach where the fire fighter keeps\nbuilding a barrier right along the boundary of the expanding fire, at constant\nspeed _v_ . Let FF _v_ denote the resulting barrier curve. At each point _Q_ both fighter\nand fire arrive simultaneously, by definition. As we shall see below, tangents form\na constant angle _α_ = cos _[−]_ [1] (1 _/v_ ) with the curve; see Figure 1, (ii).\nWhile the fighter keeps building FF _v_, the fire is coming after her along the\noutside of the barrier, as shown in Figure 2. Intuitively, the fighter can only win\nthis race, and contain the fire, if the last coil of the barrier hits the previous coil.\nFig. 2: The race between the fire and the fighter. When the fighter arrives at\npoint _p_ 2, having constructed a barrier from _p_ 0 to _p_ 2, the fire has expanded along\nthe outer side of the barrier up to point _q_ .\nThis is equivalent to saying that the length, _F_, of the tangent from the\nfighter’s current position _Q_ back to point _P_ becomes zero.\nFirst, we deduce two structural properties of barrier curve FF _v_ . They lead to\na recursive system of linear differential equations that allow us to describe the\n3\nvalues of _F_ in the _i_ -th round. It turns out that we need only check the signs of\nthe values _Fi_ at the end of round _i_, in order to see if the fighter is successful.\nTherefore, we look at the generating function _F_ ( _Z_ ) = [�] _i_ _[∞]_ =0 _[F][i][Z]_ _[i]_ [ and obtain,]\nfrom the recursions, the equation\n_F_ ( _Z_ ) _e_ _[vZ]_ _r Z_\n= _−_ (1)\n_F_ 0 _e_ _[wZ]_ _s Z_\n_−_\nwhere _v, r, w, s_ are real functions of speed _v_ . Singularities can only arise from\nzeroes of the denominator that do not cancel out with the numerator. It turns\nout that for _v > vc_ = 2 _._ 6144 _. . ._ only conjugate pairs of complex zeroes of the\ndenominator exist [13]. A theorem of Pringsheim’s directly implies that not all\ncoefficients _Fi_ of power series _F_ ( _Z_ ) can be positive, showing that barrier curve\nFF _v_ does close on itself at some time.\nTo find out after how many rounds this happens we look at the conjugate\npair of zeroes of smallest modulus and let _φv_ denote their (positive) argument.\nResidue analysis shows that _Θ_ (1 _/φv_ ) rounds are necessary before the fire is\ncontained. As speed _v_ decreases towards _vc_, the two conjugate zeroes merge\ninto a real zero. Therefore, argument _φv_ tends to 0, proving that the fire fighter\ncannot succeed at speed _v_ = _vc_ .\nLet us call a curve “spiralling” if it visits the four coordinate half-axes in cyclic\norder, and at increasing distances from the origin. (Note that curve FF _v_ is spiralling even though the fighter’s distance to the origin may be decreasing: the\nbarrier’s intersection points with any ray from 0 are of increasing order since the\ncurve does not self-intersect.)\nWe prove that a fire fighter who follows such a spiralling curve can only be\n~~_√_~~\nsuccessful if her speed exceeds [1+] 2 5 1 _._ 618, the golden ratio.\n_≈_\n**2** **Acknowledgement**\nA preliminary version of part of this paper has appeared at SoCG’15 [19]. We\nthank all anonymous referees for their valuable suggestions and, in particular,\nfor pointing out to us the work by Bressan et al. [5–12].\n**3** **The barrier curve FF** _**v**_\n**3.1** **The first rounds**\nLet _p_ be a point on the barrier curve’s first round, as depicted in Figure 3.\nIf _α_ denotes the angle between the fighter’s velocity vector at _p_ and the ray\nfrom 0 through _p_, the fighter moves at speed _v_ cos _α_ away from 0. This implies\n_v_ cos _α_ = 1, because the fire expands at unit speed and the fighter stays on its\nfrontier, by definition. Since the fighter is operating at constant speed _v_, angle\n_α_ is constant, and given by _α_ = cos _[−]_ [1] (1 _/v_ ).\n4\nConsequently, the first part of the barrier curve, between points _p_ 0 and _p_ 1\nshown in Figure 3, (i), is part of a logarithmic spiral of excentricity _α_ centered\nat 0. In polar coordinates, this segment can be desribed by ( _ϕ, A_ _·_ _e_ _[ϕ]_ [ cot] _[ α]_ ), where\nFig. 3: The barrier curve starts with two parts of logarithmic spirals of excentricity _α_, centered at 0 and _p_ 0, respectively.\n_ϕ_ [0 _,_ 2 _π_ ], and _A_ denotes the distance from the origin to _p_ 0, i.e., the fire’s\n_∈_\nintitial radius.\nIn general, the curve length of a logarithmic spiral of excentricity _α_ between\ntwo points at distance _d_ 1 _< d_ 2 to its center is known to be cos1 _α_ [(] _[d]_ [2] _[ −]_ _[d]_ [1][). Thus,]\nwe have for the length _l_ 1 of the barrier curve from _p_ 0 to _p_ 1 the equation\n_A_\n_l_ 1 = (2)\ncos _α_\n_[·]_ [ (] _[e]_ [2] _[π]_ [ cot] _[ α][ −]_ [1)] _[.]_\nFrom point _p_ 1 on, the geodesic shortest path, along which the fire spreads\nfrom 0 to the fighter’s current position, _p_, is no longer straight. It starts with\nsegment 0 _p_ 0, followed by segment _p_ 0 _p_, until, for _p_ = _p_ 2, segment _p_ 0 _p_ becomes\ntangent to the barrier curve at _p_ 0; see Figure 3, (ii). By the same arguments as\nabove, between _p_ 1 and _p_ 2 barrier curve FF _v_ is also part of a logarithmic spiral\nof excentricity _α_, but now centered at _p_ 0. This spiral segment starts at _p_ 1 at\ndistance _A_ _[′]_ = _A_ ( _e_ [2] _[π]_ [ cot] _[ α]_ _−_ 1) from its center _p_ 0. Since _p_ 2 and _p_ 1 form an angle\n_α_ at _p_ 0, the distance from _p_ 2 to _p_ 0 equals _A_ _[′]_ _e_ _[α]_ [ cot] _[ α]_ . Thus, the curve length from\n_p_ 1 to _p_ 2 is given by _l_ 2 _[′]_ [=] cos _A_ _[′]_ _α_ [(] _[e][α]_ [ cot] _[ α][ −]_ [1) =] cos _A α_ [(] _[e]_ [2] _[π]_ [ cot] _[ α][ −]_ [1)(] _[e][α]_ [ cot] _[ α][ −]_ [1).]\nConsequently, the overall curve length _l_ 2 from _p_ 0 to _p_ 2 equals\n_A_\n_l_ 2 = _l_ 1 + _l_ 2 _[′]_ [=] (3)\ncos _α_ [(] _[e]_ [2] _[π]_ [ cot] _[ α][ −]_ [1)] _[e][α]_ [ cot] _[ α][.]_\nFrom point _p_ 2 on, the geodesic shortest path from 0 to the fighter’s current position, _p_, starts wrapping around the existing spiral part of the curve, beginning at\n5\nbarrier already constructed. The last segment, _free string F_, of the shortest\npath from the fire source to the current barrier point _p_ shrinks, by wrapping,\nand simultaneously grows by cos _α_ . The fighter will be successful if, and only if,\n_F_ ever shrinks to zero.\n_p_ 0; see Figure 4.

  "introduction": "Fighting wildfires and epidemics has become a serious issue in the last decades.\nProfessional fire fighters need models and simulation tools on which strategic\ndecisions can be based; for example see [17]. Thus, a good understanding of the\ntheoretical foundations seems necessary.\nIn theoretical computer science, substantial work has been done on the fire\nfighting problem in graphs; see, e.g., the survey article [14]. Here, initially one\nvertex is on fire. Then an immobile firefighter can be placed at one of the other\nvertices. Next, the fire spreads to each adjacent vertex that is not defended by a\nfighter, and so on. The game continues until the fire cannot spread anymore. The\nobjective, to save a maximum number of vertices from the fire, is NP-hard to\nachieve, even for trees of degree three; see [15]. Optimal strategies are known for\nspecial graphs, i.e., for grid graphs [22]. The problem can also be interpreted as an\nintruder search game. The total extension of the fire in the graph represents the\ncurrent possible location of the intruder. Some algorithms and lower bounds have\nbeen given for the problem of finding an intruder in special graphs; see [1,3,4].\nA more geometric setting has been studied in [20]. Suppose that inside a\nsimple polygon _P_ a candidate set of pairwise disjoint diagonal barriers has been\ndefined. If a fire starts at some point inside _P_ one wants to build a subset of\nthese barriers in order to save a maximum area from the fire. But each point on a\nbarrier must be built before the fire arrives there. This problem is a special case\nof a hybrid scheduling and coverage problem, for which an 11.65 approximation\nalgorithm exists.\nBressan et al. [5–12] introduced a purely geometric model where a fire spreads\nin the plane and one or more fire fighters are tasked to block it by building\nbarriers. They cover a wide range of possible scenarios, including fires whose\nits length, _F_, because the fire will be contained if and only if _F_ ever attains the\nvalue 0.\nOne could think of this tangent as a string (named the _free string_ ) at whose\nendpoint, _p_, a pencil is attached that draws the barrier curve. But unlike an\ninvolute, here the string is not normal to the outer layer. Rather, its extension\nbeyond _p_ forms an angle _α_ with the barrier’s tangent at _p_ . This causes the string\nto grow in length by cos _α_ for each unit drawn. At the same time, the inner part\nof the string gets wrapped around the previous coil of the barrier. It is this\ninterplay between growing and wrapping we need to analyze.\nOne can show that after _p_ 2 no segment of positive length of FF _v_ is part of a\nlogarithmic spiral.\n**3.2** **Structural properties**\nIn this subsection we assume that the fighter has built quite a few rounds of the\nbarrier curve without yet containing the fire. That the first two rounds of the\ncurve involve two different spiral segments, around 0 and around _p_ 0, influences\nthe subsequent layers. The structure of the curve can be described as follows.\nLet _l_ 1 and _l_ 2 denote the curve lengths from _p_ 0 to _p_ 1 and _p_ 2, respectively, as in\nEquations 2 and 3. For _l_ [0 _, l_ 1] let _F_ 0( _l_ ) denote the segment connecting 0 to\n_∈_\n6\nthe point of curve length _l_ ; see the sketch given in Figure 5. At the endpoint\nFig. 5: Repeatedly constructing backwards tangents may end in 0 or in _p_ 0. This\nway, two types of linkages are defined.\nof _F_ 0( _l_ ) we construct the tangent and extend it until it hits the next layer of\nthe curve, creating a segment _F_ 1( _l_ ), and so on. This construction gives rise to\na “linkage” connecting adjacent layers of the curve. Each edge of the linkage\nis turned counterclockwise by _α_ with respect to its predecessor. The outermost\nedge of a linkage is the free string mentioned above. As parameter _l_ increases\nfrom 0 to _l_ 1, edge _F_ 0( _l_ ), and the whole linkage, rotate counterclockwise. While\n_F_ 0(0) equals the line segment from the origin to _p_ 0, edge _F_ 0( _l_ 1) equals segment\n0 _p_ 1.\nAnalogously, let _l_ _[′]_ _∈_ [ _l_ 1 _, l_ 2], and let _φ_ 0( _l_ _[′]_ ) denote the segment from _p_ 0 to the\npoint at curve length _l_ _[′]_ from _p_ 0. This segment can be extended into a linkage in\nthe same way. We observe that\n_Fj_ +1( _l_ 1) = _φj_ +1( _l_ 1) (4)\n_Fj_ +1(0) = _φj_ ( _l_ 2) (5)\nhold (but initially, we have _F_ 0( _l_ ) = _A_ + cos( _α_ ) _l_ and _φ_ 0( _l_ _[′]_ ) = cos( _α_ ) _l_ _[′]_, so that\n_F_ 0( _l_ 1) = _φ_ 0( _l_ 1)). Clearly, each point on the curve can be reached by a unique\n_̸_\nlinkage, as tangents can be constructed backwards. We refer to the two types of\n7\nlinkages by _F_ -type and _φ_ -type. As Figure 5 illustrates, points of the same linkage\ntype form alternating intervals along the barrier curve. If _p_ ’s linkage is of _F_ -type\nthen _p_ is uniquely determined by the index _j_ 0 and parameter _l_ [0 _, l_ 1] such\n_≥_ _∈_\nthat _p_ is the outer endpoint of edge _Fj_ ( _l_ ).\nNow we will derive two structural properties of _F_ -linkages on which our\nanalysis will be based; analogous facts hold for _φ_ -linkages, too. To this end, let\n_Lj_ ( _l_ ) denote the length of the barrier curve from _p_ 0 to the outer endpoint of\nedge _Fj_ ( _l_ ), and let _Fj_ ( _l_ ) also denote the length of edge _Fj_ ( _l_ ).\n**Lemma 1.** _We have Lj−_ 1( _l_ ) + _Fj_ ( _l_ ) = cos _α Lj_ ( _l_ ) _._\n_Proof._ Both, fire and fire fighter, reach the endpoint of _Fj_ ( _l_ ) at the same time.\nThe fire has travelled a geodesic distance of _Lj−_ 1( _l_ ) + _Fj_ ( _l_ ) at unit speed, the\nfighter a distance of _Lj_ ( _l_ ) at speed 1 _/_ cos _α_ .\nThe second property is related to the wrapping of the free string. Intuitively,\nit says that if we turn an _F_ -linkage, the speed of each edge’s endpoint is proportional to its length.\n**Lemma 2.** _As functions in l, Lj and Fj satisfy the following equation._\n_L_ _[′]_ _j−_ 1 [(] _[l]_ [)]\n= _[F][j][−]_ [1][(] _[l]_ [)]\n_L_ _[′]_ _j_ [(] _[l]_ [)] _Fj_ ( _l_ ) _[.]_\nWe will derive Lemma 2 from two general facts on smooth curves stated in\nLemma 3 and Lemma 4.\n**Lemma 3.** _Suppose a string of length F is tangent to a point t on some smooth_\n_curve C. Now the end of the string moves a distance of ϵ in the direction of α, as_\n_shown in Figure 6. Then for the curve length Ct_ _[t][ϵ]_ _between t and the new tangent_\n_point, tϵ, we have_\nlim _Ct_ _[t][ϵ]_ = [sin] _[ α r]_\n_ϵ→_ 0 _ϵ_ _F_\n_ϵ→_ 0 _ϵ_ _F_\n_where r denotes the radius of the osculating circle at t._\nThis fact is quite intuitive. The more perpendicular the motion of the string’s\nendpoint, and the larger the radius of curvature, the more of the string gets\nwrapped. But if the string is very long, the effect of the motion decreases.\nThe center of the osculating circle at _t_ is known to be the limit of the intersections of the normals of all points near _t_ with the normal at _t_ . Lemma 4\nshows what happens if, instead of the normals, we consider the lines turned by\nthe angle _π/_ 2 _−_ _α_ .\n**Lemma 4.** _Let t be a point on a smooth curve C, whose osculating circle at t is_\n_of radius r. Consider the lines Ls resulting from turning the normal at points s_\n_by an angle of π/_ 2 _−_ _α. Then their limit intersection point with Lt has distance_\nsin _α r to t._\n8\n_F_\n_t_\nFig. 6: A string wrapping around a curve.\nFig. 7: Intersection of turned normals.\n9\nA simple example is shown in Figure 7 for the case where curve _C_ itself is a\ncircle. Now we can prove Lemma 2.\n_Proof (Proof of Lemma 2)._ By Lemma 3, applied to the innermost point _t_ of\nedge _Fj_ ( _Lj_ ), we have\n_L_ _[′]_ _j−_ 1 [(] _[L][j]_ [)]\n= _L_ _[′]_ _j−_ 1 [(] _[L][j]_ [) =] [sin] _[ α r]_\n_L_ _[′]_ _j_ [(] _[L][j]_ [)] _Fj_ ( _Lj_ ) _[.]_\nLemma 4 implies that sin _α r_ equals the distance between _t_ and the limit intersection point of the normals turned by _π/_ 2 _−_ _α_ near _t_ . But for the barrier\ncurve FF _v_, these turned normals are the tangents to the previous coil, so that\nsin _α r_ = _Fj−_ 1( _Lj_ ) holds. As we substitute variable _Lj_ with _Lj_ ( _l_ ), the derivatives\nof the inner functions cancel out and we obtain Lemma 2.\n_Proof (Proof of Lemma 3)._ Using the notations in Figure 6, the following hold.\nFrom _r_ sin( _φ/_ 2) = _s_ = _a_ cos( _φ/_ 2) we obtain _a_ = _r_ tan( _φ/_ 2). For short, let\n_c_ := _Ct_ _[t][ϵ][.]_ [ By l’Hospital’s rule,]\n_c_ _r φ_\n2 _a_ [=] 2 _r_ tan( _φ/_ 2)\n_[≈]_ [cos][2][(] _[φ/]_ [2)] _[ →]_ [1]\nas _ϵ_, hence _φ_, go to 0.

We are proving the following.\n29\nFig. 14: The approximate number of rounds, _j_, barrier curve FF _v_ needs before\nclosing on itself.\n**Theorem 4.** _In order to contain a fire by a spiralling barrier, the fighter needs_\n_speed_\n_√_\n_v >_ [1 +]\n5\n1 _._ 618 _,_\n2 _≈_\n_the golden ratio._\n_Proof._ at maximum speed Now let _S_ be a spiralli _v_ (1 + _√_ ng5) curve, and assume that the fighter proceeds _/_ 2. Let _p_ 0 _, p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _, . . ._ denote the points on the\n_≤_\ncoordinate axes visited, in this order, by _S_ . The following lemma shows that _S_\ncannot succeed because there is still fire burning outside the barrier on the axis\npreviously visited.\n**Lemma 12.** _Let A be the initial fire radius. When S visits point pi_ +1 _, the in-_\n_terval_ [ _pi, pi_ + `sign` ( _pi_ ) _A_ ] _on the axis visited before is on fire._\n_Proof._ The proof is by induction on _i_ . Suppose barrier _S_ is of length _x_ between\n_p_ 0 and _p_ 1, as shown in Figure 15 (i). While this part is under construction, the\nfire advances _x/v_ along the positive _X_ -axis, so that _A_ + _x/v_ _p_ 1 _x_ must\nhold, or _≤_ _≤_\n_x_ 1\n_v_ _[≥]_ _v −_ 1 _[A > A]_ [;]\nthe last inequality follows from _v <_ 2. Thus, the fire has enough time to move a\ndistance of _A_ from _p_ 0 downwards along the negative _Y_ -axis.\nNow let us assume that the fighter builds a barrier of length _y_ between _pi_\nand _pi_ +1, as shown in Figure 15 (ii). By induction, the interval of length _A_\nbelow _pi−_ 1 is on fire. Also, when the fighter moves on from _pi_, there must be a\nburning interval of length at least _A_ + _x/v_ on the positive _Y_ -axis which is not\n30\n_pi_\n|Col1|A p<br>1|\n|---|---|\n|_p_||\nFig. 15: Proof of Lemma 12.\n|p<br>i+1|y<br>A|\n|---|---|\n|_i−_1|_x_<br>_A_|\nbounded by a barrier from above. This is clear if _pi_ +1 is the first point visited on\nthe positive _Y_ -axis, and it follows by induction, otherwise. Thus, we must have\n_A_ + _x/v_ + _y/v_ _pi_ +1 _y_, hence\n_≤_ _≤_\n_y_ 1 1\n_v_ _[≥]_ _v −_ 1 _[A]_ [ +] _v_ ( _v −_ 1) _[x > A]_ [ +] _[ x.]_\nThe rightmost inequality follows since _v_ is supposed to be smaller than the\ngolden ratio, which satisfies _X_ [2] _−_ _X −_ 1 = 0; hence, _v_ [2] _−_ _v <_ 1. This shows that\nthe fire has time to crawl along the barrier from _pi−_ 1 to _pi_, and a distance _A_ to\nthe right, as the fighter moves to _pi_ +1, completing the proof of Lemma 12 and\nof Theorem 4.\n**References**\n1.
