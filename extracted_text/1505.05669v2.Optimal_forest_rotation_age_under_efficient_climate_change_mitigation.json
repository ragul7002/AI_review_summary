  "abstract": "This paper considers the optimal rotation of forests when the\ncarbon ﬂows from forest growth and harvest are priced with an\nincreasing price. Such evolution of carbon price is generally asso-\nciated with economically eﬃcient climate change mitigation, and\nwould provide incentives for the land-owner for enhanced carbon\nsequestration. For an inﬁnitely long sequence of even-aged forest\nrotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rota-\ntions due to the changing carbon price. The ﬁrst-order optimality\nconditions therefore also involve an inﬁnite chain of lengths for\nconsecutive forest rotations, and allow the approximation of the\ninﬁnite-time problem with a truncated series of forest rotations.\n1Email address: tommi.ekholm@vtt.ﬁ, Tel.: +358 40 775 4079\n\nIllustrative numerical calculations show that when starting\nfrom bare land, the initial carbon price and its growth rate both\nprimarily increase the length of the ﬁrst rotation. With some com-\nbinations of the carbon pricing parameters, the optimal harvest\nage can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is released to\nthe atmosphere upon harvest.",

  "results": ".\nWith the consideration of exponentially increasing prices – contrasting from\nthe case of constant prices – the problem setting described here is not station-\nary, but changes over time as the carbon price grows. This implies that the\noptimal harvest ages diﬀer on subsequent rotations, and the optimal rotation\nlength for the same type of forest changes over time.\n\nThe paper is structured so that the problem setting is described in section\n2, followed by a derivation for the ﬁrst-order optimality conditions. Section\n3 provides numerical examples of optimal rotation ages when starting from\nbare land, the implications of increasing carbon pricing to bare land value,\nand the currently optimal harvest ages; using the forest growth curves and\nparameters from van Kooten et al. (1995). The role of these calculations is\nto illustrate the problem setting – how carbon pricing under economically\neﬃcient climate change mitigation might aﬀect forest economics – and further\nresearch should analyse optimal strategies for various actual forest stands.\nFinally, section 4 discusses the results’ implications on a broader context.\n2.",

  "conclusion": "from\nthese studies has been that the pricing of forest carbon lengthens the rota-\ntions on the stand-level, leading to a larger forest carbon stock and thus a\n\nhigher amount of sequestered atmospheric carbon.\nThe stand-level analyses referenced above have assumed a constant price\nfor carbon. However, an economically eﬃcient climate policy generally im-\nplies an increasing carbon price. This is a common result from numerous\nnumerical scenarios addressing eﬃcient climate change mitigation (see e.g.\nNordhaus, 2010). An analytical solution for limiting the temperature increase\nbelow 2◦C in a cost-eﬃcient manner suggested that the carbon price increase\nshould be close to exponential for several decades (Ekholm, 2014). Although\nan increasing carbon price has been a part of e.g.",
