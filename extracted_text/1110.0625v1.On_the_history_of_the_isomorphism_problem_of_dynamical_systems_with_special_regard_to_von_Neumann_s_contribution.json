In particular, by pub-\nlishing and analyzing (both systematically and in historical context) a hith-\nerto unpublished letter2 written in 1941 by John von Neumann to Stanislaw\nUlam, this paper aims to clarify von Neumann’s contribution to discover-\ning the relationship between spacial isomorphism and spectral isomorphism.\nThe main message of the paper is that von Neumann’s argument described\n(in a sketchy way) in his letter to Ulam is the very ﬁrst proof that spectral\nisomorphism and spacial isomorphism are not equivalent because spectral\nisomorphism is weaker than spacial isomorphism: von Neumann shows that\nspectrally isomorphic ergodic dynamical systems with mixed spectra need\nnot be spacially isomorphic.\nDynamical systems are mathematical models of systems whose time evo-\nlution is deterministic, and these include physical systems described by clas-\nsical mechanics and classical statistical mechanics. The origins of dynamical\nsystems, especially the beginnings of ergodic theory, can be traced back to\nBoltzmann’s work on the foundations of classical statistical mechanics in the\nsecond half of the 19th century (von Plato 1991, Sz´asz 1996).\nModern ergodic theory developed in the early 1930s; the papers von Neu-\nmann (1932a, 1932b, 1932c) and Koopman & von Neumann (1932) con-\ntributed substantially to the birth of this new discipline. More speciﬁcally,\nthe isomorphism problem – the problem of classifying the equivalence classes\nof dynamical systems with respect to a natural notion of spacial isomorphism\n– was ﬁrst formulated in von Neumann (1932c).\nThe development that gave a decisive boost to dynamical systems theory,\nand which motivated in particular von Neumann to turn his attention to the\nstudy of the ergodic properties of dynamical systems, was the emergence of\nwhat has become called ‘the Koopman formalism’: dynamical systems the-\nory in terms of functional analysis. Koopman (1931) observed that to each\ndynamical system there corresponds a group of unitary operators on the as-\n2In Section 3 we reproduce von Neumann’s letter in full.\nDoing so, we follow von\nNeumann’s notation and terminology closely, and we keep his notation and terminology\nthroughout the paper when we review subsequent developments about the isomorphism\nproblem although some of that notation and terminology has become outdated.\nOne\ninstance of such non-standard usage of words is ‘spacial isomorphism’ instead of ‘spatial\nisomorphism’.\n3\n\nsociated L2 Hilbert space. Hence the properties of dynamical systems can be\nanalyzed in terms of Hilbert space operator theory. The Koopman formal-\nism proved to be very powerful and successful. Many stochastic properties\nof dynamical system (such as ergodicity and diﬀerent types of mixing) could\nbe fully characterized in terms of the Koopman operators associated with\nthe dynamical system. This success raised the hope that the isomorphism\nproblem could also be solved with this technique. Von Neumann (1932c)\nintroduced a very natural notion of spectral isomorphism between Koopman\nrepresentatives of dynamical systems, and he proved that for a restricted\nclass of ergodic dynamical systems (those with pure point spectrum) spec-\ntral isomorphism is equivalent to spacial isomorphism. He also conjectured\nthat this is true in general.\nIf this were true, it would have shown that\nthe technique of the Koopman formalism is exhaustive in the sense of being\nstrong enough to describe every probabilistic aspect of dynamical systems.\nIt turned out, however, that the situation is much more complicated, and\na long and intricate history of research on the relation of spectral isomor-\nphism to spacial isomorphism ensued after von Neumann’s 1932 paper. A\nkey event in this history is von Neumann’s proof in his 1941 letter to Ulam\nthat spacial isomorphism is stronger than spectral isomorphism. Von Neu-\nmann never published his proof but his result was referred to in important\nlater publications on the problem. Given the signiﬁcance of the isomorphism\nproblem, von Neumann’s letter is an important historical document. Also,\nunderstanding von Neumann’s proof is helpful in putting later developments\ninto perspective. As it will be seen, von Neumann’s presentation of the proof\nin his letter is sketchy, and we will ﬁll in the details in order to make the\nproof understandable.\nBy giving a review of some major episodes in the history of the isomor-\nphism problem we also hope to contribute to the extremely meager literature\non the history of the isomorphism problem: while the literature on the history\nof ergodic theory is rich and there are a number of papers discussing specif-\nically von Neumann’s contribution to it (see Mackey 1990; Ornstein 1990;\nZund 2002 and the references therein), we are not aware of any historically\noriented paper devoted exclusively to the isomorphism problem, although\nsome papers on the history of ergodic theory mention it (e.g., Mackey 1990;\nLo Bello 1983).\nThe structure of the paper is the following. Section 2 recalls some deﬁ-\nnitions, including the Koopman formalism, deﬁnes the spacial isomorphism\nproblem and states the main result on the problem that had been known be-\n4\n\nfore 1941 – von Neumann’s 1932 result. In Section 3 von Neumann’s letter is\nreproduced without any comments on its content. Section 4 gives a detailed\nreconstruction of von Neumann’s proof, ﬁlling in the (sometimes very large)\ngaps. Section 5 reviews how von Neumann’s result was referred to in the\nmathematics literature. Section 6 is a collection of important more recent\nresults on the isomorphism problem. The paper is concluded with Section 7\nwhere we highlight the historical signiﬁcance of von Neumann’s letter.\n2\nThe Isomorphism Problem and von Neu-\nmann’s 1932 Result\nFirst, we recall some deﬁnitions that will be needed for the ensuing discus-\nsion, using notation that is compatible with that in von Neumann’s letter.\n(φ, Σφ, µ, S) is a (discrete)3 dynamical system if φ4 is a set (called the phase\nspace), Σφ is a σ-algebra of subsets of φ, µ is a measure on Σφ with µ(φ) = 1,\nand S : φ →φ is a bijective measurable function such that also S−1 is\nmeasurable.5\nThe deﬁnition of spacial isomorphism captures the idea that dynamical\nsystems are equivalent from a probabilistic perspective.\nDeﬁnition 1 Two dynamical systems (φ, Σφ, µ, S) and (ψ, Σψ, ν, T) are called\nspacially isomorphic if there are measurable sets φ0 ⊆φ and ψ0 ⊆ψ with the\n3 We only focus on discrete-time systems because von Neumann’s letter and all the\nrelevant results are about them.\n(The only exception are the notions and results in\nvon Neumann (1932c) discussed in this and the next section. They are formulated for\ncontinuous-time systems but can easily be transferred to discrete-time systems.)\n4‘φ’ is the notation von Neumann uses in his letter for the phase space (cf. Section 3).\nThis diﬀers from modern usage (where ‘φ’ is usually reserved for functions).\n5We also assume, as is standard in ergodic theory, that (φ, Σφ, µ) is a Lebesgue space\n(cf. Petersen 1983). (φ, Σφ, µ) is called a Lebesgue space if either φ is countable or there\nis a measure space (K, ΣK, ν), where K = [a, b) ⊆R is an interval, ΣK is the Lebesgue\nσ-algebra and ν the Lebesgue measure, such that the following holds: There is a countable\nset W ⊆φ, there is a K0 ⊆K with ν(K0) = 1, there is a φ0 ⊆φ with µ(φ0) = 1 and there\nis a bijective function c : φ0 \\ W →K0 such that\n(i) c(A)∈ΣK for all A∈Σφ, A ⊆φ0 \\ W,\n(ii) c−1(B) ∈Σφ for all B ∈ΣK, B ⊆K0,\n(iii) ν(c(A)) = µ(A) for all A ∈Σφ, A ⊆φ0 \\ W.\n5\n\nproperties 1. and 2. below and a bijection c : φ0 →ψ0 satisfying 3.(i)-(iii):\n1.

The spacial isomorphism problem is widely regarded as one\nof the most important problems, if not the most important problem, of er-\ngodic theory (cf. Halmos 1956, 96; Halmos 1960, 75; Petersen 1983, 4; Rohlin\n1960, 1). This is understandable because ergodic theory is the theory of the\nprobabilistic behaviour of dynamical systems; it is thus a crucial question\nwhich systems are equivalent from the probabilistic perspective.\nThere are two main ways to approach this problem. First, one tries to\nﬁnd spacial invariants (properties which are the same for spacially isomorphic\ndynamical systems) which show that certain kinds of dynamical systems are\nnot spacially isomorphic. Second, one aims to ﬁnd a suﬃciently large number\nof invariants which, taken together, provide suﬃcient conditions for systems\nto be isomorphic.\nNext we brieﬂy describe the Koopman formalism, which will lead to the\nnotion of spectral isomorphism of dynamical systems. Given a dynamical sys-\ntem (φ, Σφ, µ, S) consider the Hilbert space L2(φ) of complex-valued square\nintegrable functions on φ. The operator\nU : L2(φ) →L2(φ),\nU(f) = f(S(x))\nis called the Koopman operator of (φ, Σφ, µ, S). Koopman (1931) showed that\nthe Koopman operator is unitary (cf. Arnold & Avez 1968). The spectrum\nof the Koopman operator U is called the spectrum of the dynamical system.\nDeﬁnition 2 Two dynamical systems (φ, Σφ, µ, S) and (ψ, Σψ, ν, T) are called\nspectrally (or unitary) isomorphic if their Koopman operators U and V are\nunitarily equivalent, i.e. if there is a unitary operator W between L2(φ) and\nL2(ψ) such that U = W ∗V W.\n6\n\nSpectral invariants are properties which are the same for spectrally isomor-\nphic dynamical systems. Obviously, the spectrum of a dynamical system is a\nspectral invariant: two dynamical systems cannot be spectrally isomorphic if\nthey have diﬀerent spectrum. However, having the same spectrum does not\nentail that they are spectrally isomorphic (Halmos 1951, 75).\nWhat is the relation of spectral and spacial invariants? Are they identi-\ncal? If yes, then spacial isomorphism is equivalent to spectral isomorphism.\nThese questions were raised by von Neumann (1932c). An aﬃrmative answer\nto the question about the equivalence of spectral and spacial isomorphism\nwould mean that the Koopman formalism can deal with all the probabilistic\nquestions about dynamical systems (cf. von Neumann 1932c; Halmos 1957).\nThe main result on this problem before von Neumann’s 1941 letter to\nUlam was presented in von Neumann’s (1932c) seminal paper. The paper\nstarts by listing several properties of dynamical systems which are spacial\ninvariants but are also spectral invariants and hence can be characterized\ncompletely in terms of the Koopman representatives of dynamical systems.\nWe recall here two of the most prominent of these properties and their spec-\ntral characterizations.\nA dynamical system (φ, Σφ, µ, S) is called (cf. Petersen 1983)\nErgodic: (or metrically transitive): if it does not have non-trivial S-invariant\nmeasurable sets, i.e. if there is no set A ∈Σφ, 0 < µ(A) < 1, such that\nS(A) = A.\nSpectral characterisation of ergodicity: 1 is a simple proper value6 of\nthe Koopman operator U.\nWeakly mixing: if for all A, B ∈Σφ we have\nlim\nt→∞\n1\nt\nt−1\nX\ni=0\n|µ(Si(A) ∩B) −µ(A)µ(B)| = 0.\nSpectral characterisation of weak mixing: 1 is the only proper value of\nthe Koopman operator and this proper value is simple.\n6‘Proper value’ and ‘proper function’ are also called ‘eigenvalue’ and ‘eigenfunction’, but\nwe follow here (and throughout the paper) von Neumann’s terminology in his letter (see\nSection 3). ‘Proper value’ and ‘proper function’ also is the terminology in the literature\nwe will refer to (e.g., Halmos 1949, 1956). A proper value δ is simple (also called ‘non-\ndegenerate’) if the proper functions belonging to δ span a one-dimensional subspace in\nL2(φ).\n7\n\nThe focus of von Neumann 1932c then turned to the question about\nthe relationship between spacial and spectral isomorphism.\nIt is obvious\nthat if (φ, Σφ, µ, S) and (ψ, Σψ, ν, T) are spacially isomorphic, then they are\nspectrally isomorphic: if c is the spacial isomorphism, then W deﬁned by\nW(f(φ)) = f(c−1(ψ))\nsets up the spectral equivalence of the dynamical systems.\nThis implies\nthat spectral invariants, such as the spectrum of a system, are also spacial\ninvariants. Thus the question to answer was whether the converse is true.\nTo tackle this question, von Neumann (1932c) distinguished between sev-\neral types of spectra of dynamical systems. A dynamical system (φ, Σφ, µ, S)\nis said to have pure point spectrum if the proper functions of the Koopman\noperator U form a basis of L2(φ). A dynamical system has pure continu-\nous spectrum if the only proper functions of its Koopman operator are δ1,\nδ ∈C. A dynamical system has mixed spectrum if it has neither a pure point\nspectrum nor a pure continuous spectrum.\nVon Neumann then proved the following theorem.7\nTheorem 1 Let (φ, Σφ, µ, S) and (ψ, Σψ, ν, T) be ergodic dynamical systems\nwith pure point spectrum. Then the dynamical systems are spacially isomor-\nphic if, and only if, they are spectrally isomorphic (von Neumann 1932c).\nIt is easy to see that spectrally isomorphic systems have the same proper val-\nues. Thus Theorem 1 tells us that ergodic systems with pure point spectrum\nare spacially isomorphic precisely when they have the same proper values.\nTheorem 1 was the main result on the isomorphism problem before von\nNeumann’ 1941 letter. The theorem shows that for ergodic systems with\npure point spectrum the Koopman formalism can deal with all probabilistic\nquestions about dynamical systems. To the best of our knowledge, noth-\ning was known about the other cases of a mixed spectrum and continuous\nspectrum before the 1941 letter. Yet in these early days of ergodic theory it\nwas sometimes conjectured that, in general, dynamical systems are spacially\nisomorphic jus"
