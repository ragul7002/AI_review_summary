  "abstract": "Understanding historical forest dynamics, speciﬁcally changes in forest biomass and carbon stocks,\nhas become critical for assessing current forest climate beneﬁts and projecting future beneﬁts under\nvarious policy, regulatory, and stewardship scenarios. Carbon accounting frameworks based exclu-\nsively on national forest inventories are limited to broad-scale estimates, but model-based approaches\nthat combine these inventories with remotely sensed data can yield contiguous ﬁne-resolution maps\nof forest biomass and carbon stocks across landscapes over time. Here we describe a fundamental\nstep in building a map-based stock-change framework: mapping historical forest biomass at ﬁne\ntemporal and spatial resolution (annual, 30m) across all of New York State (USA) from 1990 to 2019,\nusing freely available data and open-source tools.\nUsing Landsat imagery, US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and off-the-\nshelf LiDAR collections we developed three modeling approaches for mapping historical forest\naboveground biomass (AGB): training on FIA plot-level AGB estimates (direct), training on LiDAR-\nderived AGB maps (indirect), and an ensemble averaging predictions from the direct and indirect\nmodels. Model prediction surfaces (maps) were tested against FIA estimates at multiple scales. All\nthree approaches produced viable outputs, yet tradeoffs were evident in terms of model complexity,\n  [stat.AP]  5 Apr 2023\n\nMAPPING FOREST BIOMASS FOR STOCK-CHANGE - 2023-04-04\nmap accuracy, saturation, and ﬁne-scale pattern representation.",
  "introduction": "Forests are among the most effective natural carbon sinks and thus are essential in stabilizing Earth’s climate, but\ntheir capacity to provide this critical service has been strongly shaped by past and present anthropogenic impacts.\nUnderstanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest carbon in relation to human activities has become increasingly\nimportant as policymakers and stakeholders look to nature-based solutions to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG)\nconcentrations and mitigate climate change (Malmsheimer et al. 2008; Fargione et al. 2018). With a better grasp of local\nsocial and ecological conditions across the forest landscape, decision-makers could identify and prioritize parcels of\nland suitable for different strategies such as reforestation, avoided conversion, or enhanced forest management, in order\nto sustain and/or increase carbon sequestration and effectively offset GHG emissions from other sectors (Houghton\n2005; Houghton et al. 2012).",

  "methodology": "that requires historical data and ongoing monitoring efforts via permanent plot\nnetworks.\nNational forest inventories (NFI) like the USDA’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program provide estimates of\nforest biomass, carbon stocks, and stock-changes at large scales based on their extensive sampling design. Although\nthese programs have offered fundamental insights and essential data on forest carbon dynamics over the past three\ndecades (Buendia et al. 2019; Woodall et al. 2015), they are limited spatially by the sample density and remeasurement\nfrequency (McRoberts 2011), and thus cannot represent ﬁne-scaled patterns and dynamics most relevant to planning and\ndecision-making. Model-based approaches, which combine ﬁeld data like the FIA with wall-to-wall remotely-sensed\ndata can ﬁll this need by producing predictions for all map units (pixels) in a given area.\nLargely due to limitations of the available data, implementing model-based approaches for characterizing historical\nspatiotemporal dynamics of forest carbon remains challenging.",
  "results": "produced following this\nframework not only provide inputs for stock-change analyses at scales germane to management, but will also broadly\nsupport forest stewardship, future research, and ongoing planning.\nData and methods\n2.1\nOverview\nWe developed three modeling approaches (Figure 1) to map aboveground biomass (AGB) annually across New York\nState (NYS). The direct approach used AGB estimates at USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA; Gray et al. (2012))\nﬁeld plots as a dependent variable. The indirect approach used LiDAR-based predictions of AGB developed by Johnson\net al. (2022) as a dependent variable.",
  "discussion": "In this study we combined temporally smoothed, segmented, and gap-ﬁlled Landsat imagery with a sample of LiDAR-\nbased aboveground biomass (AGB) predictions and a set of the USDA’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) ﬁeld plots\nto produce annual wall-to-wall maps of AGB for New York State (NYS), USA. To this end, we developed three separate\nmodeling approaches including direct, indirect, and ensemble approaches. Overall, we found that all three modeling\napproaches performed similarly, indicating that each approach could be satisfactory on its own, yet tradeoffs were\nevident relating to model complexity, map accuracy, saturation, and representation of ﬁne spatial patterns. Comparisons\nto existing studies with similar goals, but in temperate regions with different disturbance and management regimes,\nindicated that the basic methods herein can be leveraged to track forest biomass dynamics across ecological domains and\nwithin working forests regardless of the dominating forestry practices. The maps produced from each modeling approach\noffer valuable insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of forest structure, development, disturbance, and change over\n30 years and can serve as inputs for a variety of applications related to map-based stock-change assessments, screening\nor prioritizing forest parcels for enrollment in nature-based climate programs, and future monitoring, reporting, and\nveriﬁcation (MRV) systems across NYS.\n4.1\nTradeoffs among modeling approaches\nThere was no single winner among the three modeling approaches, but rather each offered a set of beneﬁts that can\nappeal to different project-speciﬁc constraints and goals.",
  "conclusion": "Fine-resolution maps of historical forest dynamics can serve as inputs to spatially explicit stock-change accounting\nframeworks that offer critical information for projecting carbon outcomes of land stewardship decisions at parcel to\nlandscape scales. There is an essential need for methods that can deliver these historical datasets in the near term and\nthat offer reproducible, consistent, and widely applicable data products. We have demonstrated three model-based\napproaches leveraging open source data, software, and tools to predict AGB annually, at a 30 m resolution, across\nNew York State (NYS) for the past three decades (1990-2019). Our results show that each of the three approaches\nprovide valid outputs and offer unique beneﬁts relative to each other, thus offering a set of options for NYS where\nforests are expected to contribute substantially as carbon sinks towards achieving a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.\nMore broadly, the map products produced here can help managers and decision-makers maximize the role forested\nlandscapes will play in natural climate solutions and policies.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the USDA FIA program for their data sharing and cooperation, the Dutch Pension Fund and F\n& W Forest Management, LLC for sharing management records, the NYS GPO for compiling and serving LiDAR\ndata, and the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Ofﬁce of Climate Change for funding support.
