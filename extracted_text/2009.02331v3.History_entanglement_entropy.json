We deﬁne a history vector, living in a tensor\nspace with basis elements corresponding to the allowed histories, i.e. histo-\nries with nonvanishing amplitudes. The amplitudes are the components of\nthe history vector, and contain the dynamical information. Probabilities of\nmeasurement sequences, and resulting collapse, are given by generalized Born\nrules: they are all expressed by means of projections and scalar products in-\nvolving the history vector. Entangled history states are introduced, and a\nhistory density matrix is deﬁned in terms of ensembles of history vectors. The\ncorresponding history entropies (and history entanglement entropies for com-\nposite systems) are explicitly computed in two examples taken from quantum\ncomputation circuits.\nleonardo.castellani@uniupo.it\narXiv:2009.02331v3  [quant-ph]  13 Feb 2021\n\nContents\n1\nIntroduction\n1\n2\nChain operators and probabilities\n2\n3\nAmplitudes\n3\n4\nHistory vector, probabilities and collapse\n4\n5\nHistory entanglement\n7\n6\nDensity matrix and history entropy\n8\n7\nExamples\n12\n7.1\nEntangler-disentangler . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n13\n7.2\nTeleportation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n15\n8\nConclusions\n18\n1\nIntroduction\nFormulations of quantum mechanics based on histories, rather than on states at\na given time, have their logical roots in the work of Feynman [1, 2] (see also the\ninspirational Chapter 32 of Dirac’s book [3]), and could be seen as generalizations of\nthe path-integral approach. A list with the references more relevant for the present\nwork is given in [4]-[20].\nWe have seen in [20] how to deﬁne a history operator on the Hilbert space\nH of a physical system, in terms of which to compute probabilities of successive\nmeasurements at times t1, ...tn. In the present note we introduce a history vector,\nliving in a tensor space H ⊙H... ⊙H, where every H corresponds to a particular\nti. This vector contains the same information as the history operator, but is more\nsuited to deﬁne entanglement of histories, and compute their density matrices and\ncorresponding von Neumann entropies.\nThis approach is similar in spirit to the one advocated in ref.s [15]-[19], but\nwith substantial diﬀerences. In [15]-[19] the scalar product between history states\ndepends on chain operators containing information on evolution and measurements.\nIn our framework the algebraic structure does not depend on the dynamics, and all\npossible histories (not only “consistent” sets) correspond to orthonormal vectors in\nH ⊙H... ⊙H. The dynamical information is instead encoded in the coeﬃcients\n(amplitudes) multiplying the basis vectors.\nThe Born rules for probabilities and collapse are extended to history vectors\nin a straightforward way. Every history vector has a pictorial representation in\nterms of allowed histories, and its collapse after a measurement sequence entails\nthe disappearance of some histories. In this sense measurement “alters the past”,\n1\n\nbut never in a way to endanger causality. As an illustration, the formalism is applied\nto the entangler-disentangler and the teleportation quantum circuits.\nThe content of the paper is as follows. Chain operators and probabilities for\nmultiple measurements at diﬀerent times are recalled in Section 2. Section 3 in-\ntroduces history amplitudes, an essential ingredient in the deﬁnition of the history\nvector, given in Section 4. The generalized Born rules for probabilities of outcome\nsequences and collapse are derived, using appropriate projectors on the history vec-\ntor. In Section 5 we propose a deﬁnition for history entanglement, based on a tensor\nproduct between history states. Section 6 deals with density matrices, constructed\nusing ensembles of history vectors. This allows the computation of history entropy,\nand history entanglement entropy for composite systems. Two examples based on\nquantum computation circuits are provided in Section 7, and we calculate their\nhistory entanglement entropy. Section 8 contains some conclusions.\n2\nChain operators and probabilities\nAs recalled in [20], probabilities of obtaining sequences α = α1, α2, ...αn of mea-\nsurement results, starting from an initial state |ψ⟩, can all be expressed in terms\nof a chain operator Cψ,α. This operator encodes measurements at times t1, ...tn\ncorresponding to projectors Pα1, ...Pαn, and unitary time evolution between mea-\nsurements:\nCψ,α = PαnU(tn, tn−1) Pαn−1 U(tn−1, tn−2) · · · Pα1 U(t1, t0)Pψ\n(2.1)\nwith t0 < t1 < · · · < tn−1 < tn and Pψ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|.\nThe Pαi are projectors on\neigensubspaces of observables, satisfying orthogonality and completeness relations:\nPαiPβi = δαi,βiPαi,\nI =\nX\nαi\nPαi\n(2.2)\nand U(ti+1, ti) is the evolution operator between times ti and ti+1.\nThe probability of obtaining the sequence α is given by\np(ψ, α1, · · · αn) = Tr(Cψ,αC†\nψ,α)\n(2.3)\nand could be considered the “probability of the history” ψ, α1, · · · αn . We can easily\nprove that the sum of all these probabilities gives 1:\nX\nα\nTr(Cψ,αC†\nψ,α) = 1\n(2.4)\nby using the completeness relations in (2.2) and unitarity of the U(ti+1, ti) operators.\nWe also ﬁnd\nX\nαn\np(ψ, α1, α2, · · · , αn) = p(ψ, α1, α2, · · · , αn−1)\n(2.5)\n2\n\nHowever other standard sum rules for probabilities are not satisﬁed in general. For\nexample relations of the type\nX\nα2\np(ψ, α1, α2, α3) = p(ψ, α1, α3)\n(2.6)\nhold only if the so-called decoherence condition is satisﬁed:\nTr(Cψ,αC†\nψ,β) + c.c. = 0 when α ̸= β\n(2.7)\nas can be checked on the example (2.6) written in terms of chain operators, and\neasily generalized. Note that for chain operators the following is trivially true:\nX\nαi\nCψ,α1,...αn = Cψ,α1,...αi\n/,...αn\n(2.8)\ndue to P\nαi Pαi = I.\nIf all the histories we consider are such that the decoherence condition holds,\nthey are said to form a consistent set, and can be assigned probabilities satisfying\nall the standard sum rules.\nIn general, histories do not form a consistent set: interference eﬀects between\nthem can be important, as in the case of the double slit experiment. For this reason\nwe will not limit ourselves to consistent sets. Formula (2.3) for the probability of\nsuccessive measurement outcomes holds true in any case.\n3\nAmplitudes\nIf Pαn = |αn⟩⟨αn|, i.e. the eigenvalue αn is nondegenerate, the chain operator can\nbe written as\nCψ,α = |αn⟩A(ψ, α)⟨ψ|\n(3.1)\nwhere\nA(ψ, α) = ⟨αn|U(tn, tn−1) Pαn−1 U(tn−1, tn−2) · · · Pα1 U(t1, t0)|ψ⟩\n(3.2)\nis the amplitude of the history ψ, α, and\n|A(ψ, α)|2 = Tr(Cψ,αC†\nψ,α) = p(ψ, α)\n(3.3)\nThis easily generalizes to the case of a gn-degenerate eigenvalue αn, with corre-\nsponding (orthonormal) eigenvectors |αn, i⟩(i = 1, ...gn):\nCψ,α =\nX\ni\n|αn, i⟩Ai(ψ, α)⟨ψ|,\nX\ni\n|Ai(ψ, α)|2 = Tr(Cψ,αC†\nψ,α) = p(ψ, α)\n(3.4)\nthe amplitudes Ai(ψ, α) being given by formula (3.2) where ⟨αn| is substituted by\n⟨αn, i|.\n3\n\nA scalar product between chain operators can be deﬁned as\n(Cψ,α, Cψ,β) ≡Tr(Cψ,αC†\nψ,β)\n(3.5)\nAll the properties of a (complex) scalar product hold, in particular\n(Cψ,α, Cψ,α) = p(ψ, α) = 0\n⇐⇒\nCψ,α = 0\n(3.6)\nNote : if we divide the set α1, ...αn−1 into two complementary sets αi1, ...αim and\nαj1, ...αjp with m + p = n −1, then\nX\nαj1,...αjp\nA(ψ, α1, ...αn−1, αn) = A(ψ, αi1, ...αim, αn)\n(3.7)\nbecause of the completeness relations in (2.2). This just rephrases property (2.8)\nfor chain operators, with the diﬀerence that αn is never summed on since it enters\nthe amplitude (3.2) as a bra rather than as a projector.\n4\nHistory vector, probabilities and collapse\nConsider a physical system in the state |ψ⟩at time t0 and devices that can be\nactivated at times t1, ...tn to measure given observables, with projectors on eigen-\nsubspaces as in (2.2). Before any measurement, the system can be described by a\nhistory vector, living in n-tensor space\n|Ψ⟩=\nX\nα\nA(ψ, α)|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩\n(4.1)\nwhere the coeﬃcients A(ψ, α) are given by the amplitudes of the histories α =\nα1, ...αn, computed as in the previous Section, and |αk⟩are a basis of orthonormal\nvectors at each time tk.\nIf no degeneracy was present, these vectors would be\njust the eigenvectors of the observable(s) measured at time tk. If the αk (k < n)\neigenvalues are degenerate, the information on degeneracy is lost in the symbol\n|αk⟩, but is contained in the amplitude A(ψ, α), where the projectors Pαk on the\neigensubspaces are present. In case αn is degenerate, the sum on α in (4.1) must\ninclude the degeneracy index i, and (4.1) will be short for\n|Ψ⟩=\nX\nα,i\nAi(ψ, α)|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn−1⟩⊙|αn, i⟩\n(4.2)\nNote : In the following we will assume for simplicity that αn is nondegenerate:\nall the results generalize easily to the degenerate case, usually by summing on the\nindex i.\nThe “time product” ⊙has all the properties of a tensor product. The symbol ⊗\n(or just a blank) will be reserved for tensor products between states of subsystems\nat the same time tk. The vector is normalized since\n⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩=\nX\nα\n|A(ψ, α)|2 = 1\n(4.3)\n4\n\nThe history content of the system is deﬁned to be the set of histories α = α1, ...αn\ncontained in |Ψ⟩, i.e. all histories having nonvanishing amplitudes.\nProbabilities of measuring sequences α = α1, ...αn are given by the familiar\nformula\np(ψ, α) = ⟨Ψ|Pα|Ψ⟩= |A(ψ, α)|2.\n(4.4)\nwith\nPα = |α1⟩⟨α1| ⊙... ⊙|αn⟩⟨αn|\n(4.5)\nFormula (4.4) holds for sequences of measurements occurring at all times t1, ...tn.\nWhat is the eﬀect of a sequence of measurements with results α1, ...αn on the\nsystem described by |Ψ⟩? We can characterize this eﬀect as a collapse of the history\nvector, implemented mathematically by Pα. This projection collapses the state |Ψ⟩\ninto the basis vector |α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩up to a phase:\n|Ψ⟩\n−→\nPα|Ψ⟩\np\n⟨Ψ|Pα|Ψ⟩\n= |α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩\n(4.6)\nThe basis vector describes a system that has been “completely measured” with\nresults α1, ...αn.\nAnother sequence of measurements of the same observables at\ntimes ti would yield the same results α1, ...αn with probability one, according to the\nrule (4.4).\nA partial measurement at times ti1, ...tim (m < n) yielding the sequence αi1, ...αim\nlikewise projects the state vector |Ψ⟩into\n|Ψα⟩=\nPα|Ψ⟩\np\n⟨Ψ|Pα|Ψ⟩\n(4.7)\nwhere now Pα is the projector on the sequence αi1, ...αim, i.e. a tensor product of\nidentity operators and projectors at times ti1, ...tim:\nPα = I ⊙... ⊙|αi1⟩⟨αi1| ⊙I ⊙... ⊙|αim⟩⟨αim| ⊙I ⊙...\n(4.8)\nThen |Ψα⟩is given, up to a normalization, by the expression (4.1) where the sum\non α involves only the times tj diﬀerent from ti1, ...tim, the rest of the α’s being\nﬁxed to the values αi1, ...αim.\nThe projected history vector |Ψα⟩can be used to compute conditional proba-\nbilities. The probability of obtaining the results βj1, ...βjp at times tj1, ...tjp, given\nthat αi1, ...αim are obtained at times ti1, ...tim (with j1, ...jp and i1, ...im having no\nintersection, and union coinciding with 1, ...n), is given by\np(β|α) = ⟨Ψα|Pβ|Ψα⟩\n(4.9)\nFinally, to compute probabilities for sequences αi1, ...αim in partial measure-\nments at times ti1, ...tim, we need a “shorter” history vector with a reduced number\n5\n\nof factors in the ⊙product corresponding to the subset ti1, ...tim. This vector can be\nobtained from Pα|Ψ⟩(with Pα as in (4.8)) by using a further projection P, deﬁned\non the basis vectors as:\nPi1,...im|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩≡|αi1⟩⊙... ⊙|αim⟩\n(4.10)\nif ti1, ...tim contains tn, and as\nPi1,...im|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩≡|αi1⟩⊙... ⊙|αim⟩⊙|αn⟩\n(4.11)\nif ti1, ...tim does not contain tn. For example\nP1,3,5|α1⟩⊙|α2⟩⊙|α3⟩⊙|α4⟩⊙|α5⟩= |α1⟩⊙|α3⟩⊙|α5⟩\n(4.12)\nP1,2|α1⟩⊙|α2⟩⊙|α3⟩⊙|α4⟩⊙|α5⟩= |α1⟩⊙|α2⟩⊙|α5⟩\n(4.13)\nThe action of P is then extended by linearity on any |Ψ⟩. Applying it to the vector\nPα|Ψ⟩yields, when ti1, ...tim contains tn:\nPi1,...imPα|Ψ⟩= Pi1,...im\nX\nαj1,...αjp\nA(ψ, α)|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩=\n=\n\nX\nαj1,...αjp\nA(ψ, α)\n\n|αi1⟩⊙... ⊙|αim⟩= A(ψ, αi1, ...αim) |αi1⟩⊙... ⊙|αim⟩\n(4.14)\nwhere we have used eq. (3.7) in the second line. Then the probability |A(ψ, αi1, ...αim)|2\nof obtaining the partial sequence αi1, ...αim can be expressed as a scalar product\np(ψ, αi1, ...αim) = |A(ψ, αi1, ...αim)|2 = ⟨Ψ|PαP†\ni1,...imPi1,...imPα|Ψ⟩\n(4.15)\nwhere ⟨α1| ⊙... ⊙⟨αn|P†\ni1,...im is the conjugate of (4.10) or (4.11). Note that\nQi1,...im ≡P†\ni1,...imPi1,...im\n(4.16)\nis a hermitian operator in n-tensor space, with matrix elements\n⟨α1| ⊙... ⊙⟨αn|Qi1,...im|β1⟩⊙... ⊙|βn⟩= δαi1βi1 · · · δαimβim\n(4.17)\nWhen ti1, ...tim does not contain tn, αn must be contained in αj1, ...αjp, and we have\nPi1,...imPα|Ψ⟩= Pi1,...im\nX\nαj1,...αjp−1,αn\nA(ψ, α)|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩=\n=\nX\nαn\n\n\nX\nαj1,...αjp−1\nA(ψ, α)\n\n|αi1⟩⊙... ⊙|αim⟩⊙|αn⟩=\n=\nX\nαn\nA(ψ, αi1, ...αim, αn) |αi1⟩⊙... ⊙|αim⟩⊙|αn⟩\n(4.18)\n6\n\nThe sequence probability |A(ψ, αi1, ...αim)|2 is given by the same scalar product:\n⟨Ψ|PαQi1,...imPα|Ψ⟩=\nX\nαn\n|A(ψ, αi1, ...αim, αn)|2 = |A(ψ, αi1, ...αim)|2\n(4.19)\nin virtue of relation (2.5). Therefore we have established the formula\np(ψ, αi1, ...αim) = ⟨Ψ|PαQi1,...imPα|Ψ⟩\n(4.20)\nfor any partial sequence αi1, ...αim.\nNote: when m = 0 (and therefore αn is contained in αj1, ...αjp), Pα = identity\nin tensor space and P projects on tn.\nThe projected vector in (4.18) becomes\nP\nαn A(ψ, αn)|αn⟩and is just the (usual) state vector |ψ(tn)⟩of the system at time\ntn, since\n|ψ(tn)⟩= U(tn, t0)|ψ⟩=\nX\nαn\n|αn⟩⟨αn|U(ti1, t0)|ψ⟩=\nX\nαn\nA(ψ, αn)|αn⟩\n(4.21)\nIn conclusion, probabilities for (sequences of) measurements at any times can be\ncomputed via scalar products involving appropriate projections of the history vector\n|Ψ⟩.\n5\nHistory entanglement\nIt is useful to deﬁne a tensor product between history vectors of subsystems. On\nthe basis history vectors the product acts as\n(|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩)(|β1⟩⊙... ⊙|βn⟩) ≡|α1⟩|β1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩|βn⟩\n(5.1)\nand is extended by bilinearity on all linear combinations of these vectors. No symbol\nis used for this tensor product, to distinguish it from the tensor product ⊙involving\ndiﬀerent times tk.\nThis allows a deﬁnition of product history states, which are deﬁned to be ex-\npressible in the form:\n(\nX\nα\nA(ψ, α)|α1⟩⊙... ⊙|αn⟩)(\nX\nβ\nA(ψ, β)|β1⟩⊙... ⊙|βn⟩)\n(5.2)\nor, using bilinearity:\nX\nα,β\nA(ψ, α)A(ψ, β)|α1β1⟩⊙... ⊙|αnβn⟩\n(5.3)\nwith |αiβi⟩≡|αi⟩|βi⟩for short. A product history state is thus characterized by\nfactorized amplitudes A(ψ, α, β) = A(ψ, α)A(ψ, β).\n7\n\nIf the history state cannot be expressed as a product, we deﬁne it to be history\nentangled1. In this case, results of measurements on system A are correlated with\nthose on system B and viceversa.
