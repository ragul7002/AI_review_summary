In this way, they can increase flexibility, diversify applications and simplify the way\nof life of human beings within a broad field of different branches [1, 2]. In order to reliably\nnavigate towards their destination and to safely avoid collisions with known obstacles, walls\nor other AMRs, they must determine their position.",

  "discussion": "about practical aspects\n6.1. Robustness against multipath fading\nIn indoor environments, the effect of multipath fading is generally stronger than outdoors since\nthey are closed and narrow. While fingerprinting takes advantage of this, it is a challenge for\nmost other radio transmission based indoor positioning methods in practice. Also the radar\ntransmission of our proposed approach needs to cope with it. Accordingly, in the following, we\nwill discuss the robustness of our method against multipath fading.\nIn terms of our application, multipath fading describes the effect that there are not only the\ndesired direct paths from the radar TX antenna to the reflectors and back to the RX antenna.\nInstead, there are also countless other disturbing paths from the TX to the RX antenna like\nreflections from objects, the walls, the ceiling or even multi-reflections.",
  "conclusion": ", there is a lack of low-cost and easy to use but still highly accurate indoor\npositioning techniques. This especially holds for industrial applications like AMRs, since they\ntypically require highly accurate estimates of the absolute position while operating in a regularly\nchanging environment.\n3. Basic Idea\nThe basic idea of our novel approach towards indoor positioning is to equip the environment with\nmultiple low-cost passive retroreflectors such that a radar system mounted on an AMR observes\n\na unique reflection characteristic at each position. In general, this reflection characteristic can\ninclude the distances, angles and relative velocities between the vehicle and the reflectors as\nwell as the radar cross sections (RCSs) and polarimetrics of the corresponding reflectors. In the\nremainder of this paper, the reflectors will be denoted as local reference points (LRPs) and we\nwill refer to the observed reflection characteristics as the LRP fingerprints.\nAccordingly, our method combines the ideas of geometry- and fingerprint-based methods\nto get the best of both worlds.",
