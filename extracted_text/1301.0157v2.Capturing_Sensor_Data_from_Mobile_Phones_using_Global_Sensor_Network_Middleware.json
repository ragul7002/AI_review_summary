  "introduction": "Mobile phones have built-in sensors that can be used to measure different parameters such as motion, position and various environmental conditions. The sensing capability and data processing power of mobile phones have been increased during the past decade. A decade ago, there weren’t any processors in mobile phones. The industry has evolved and latest mobile phones comprise 1.4 GHz dual-core processors and 1GB ram. This enables significant potential to build sensor networks using mobile phones. One of the major challenges in sensor networks is deployment of sensors. Deployment of traditional sensor network requires to bear significant cost and effort. However, sensors in mobile phones do not require a deployment. Mobile phones are already in the hands of 5.6 billion [12] people around the world. Therefore, it is cheap to use these sensors built into the mobile phones. This fact motivates us to capture sensor data using mobile phones. Without putting substantial effort into typical sensor deployment, sensors built-in to the mobile phones can be utilised to understand mobile users and the environments around them. The raw data produced by these sensors built-in the mobile phones need to be collected and processed. Sensor data stream processing engines provide a solution for this [1]. \nInternet of Things (IoT) [14] is a concept that is closely related to and motivated by sensor networks. The European Union has defined the IoT vision and explained the applications in detail in [8]. Mobile phones are a critical component in the IoT as they are capable of performing more computation than other _smart objects_ [10]. \nUsing mobile phones as sensors has a significant advantage over unattended wireless sensor networks. We do not need to put extra effort to power the built-in sensors in mobile phones. Mobile phones are powered (charged) by human beings regularly. Furthermore, sensors built into mobile phones can provide more coverage than static sensors. \nThe availability of cheap, cost effective and widely available sensors built-in to mobile phones enable a whole new range of applications across a wide variety of domains, such as healthcare, smart home and office, social networks, safety, public parks, shopping malls, environmental monitoring, transportation and logistics. In addition, it is very easy to distribute applications for mobile phones. Almost all the mobile platforms provide easy methods to download and install applications for mobile phones such as iPhone (App Store iOS), Android (Android Market), Windows (Windows Phone Marketplace) and Blackberry (Blackberry App World). This has enabled the possibility to reach millions of users very easily. \nMobile phone sensing is a fairly new field which emerged with the increasing sensing capability of modern mobiles phones. Lane et al. [11] has conducted a survey on mobile phone sensing. Mobile sensing does raise many question in term of security and privacy. These two issues are discussed in detail in [9], [2]. As mentioned earlier, sensor data collection and processing is also an important component in mobile phone sensing systems. Sensor data stream processing engines such as Global Sensor Network [6] provides basic functionalities that required by such a system. \nLet’s introduce an application scenario. A farmer visits his field of crops and collects sensor data from variety of different sensors deployed. The mobile phone annotates collected raw sensor data with various context information such as location, time, etc. and sends them to GSN for storage, analysis, and interpretation. Our main contribution, DAM4GSN architecture, allows GSN to capture context annotated sensor data from lowlevel computational devices such as mobile phones without porting GSN itself into mobile phones. \nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II presents an overview on sensing capability of the mobile phones. Section III describes the Global Sensor Network middleware in brief. A detailed description about the entire system, including client configuration, server configuration, and data formats is provided in Section IV. The life cycle of the developed wrappers is discussed in Section V. Section VI provides a detailed explanation of wrapper development. \nFinally, Section VIII presents the performance evaluation of the proposed system.",

In our approach, we evaluate the process of connecting a sensor to a data processing engine called GSN. _AndroidWrapper_ was developed in order to retrieve sensor data from mobile phones.
