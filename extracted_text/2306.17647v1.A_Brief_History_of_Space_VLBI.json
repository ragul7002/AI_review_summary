The paper\nprovides a brief account of the history of developments of this\ntechnique over the period 1960s–2020s.\nIndex Terms—radio astronomy, VLBI, angular resolution\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe year 2023 marks the 90th birthday of radio astronomy:\nit is commonly accepted that this large branch of astronomy\nhad been “launched” with a column on the front page of\nNew York Times of 5 May 1933 describing the discovery of\n“cosmic noise” by Karl Jansky [1]. For almost two thirds of\nthis period, since the mid-1960s, a radio astronomy technique\ncalled Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) firmly holds\nthe record in angular resolution when viewing celestial objects\n(provided they emit in the radio domain of the electromagnetic\nspectrum). The first experimental demonstration of this tech-\nnique took place in 1967 by three US and one Canadian groups\n(see [2], section 1.3.14, and references therein). The technique\nwas discussed two years earlier in [3]. Interestingly, the latter\npublication in its draft version of 1963 contained a paragraph\nreferring to a potential placement of a radio interferometer\nantenna on a spacecraft aiming to achieve an angular resolution\nfundamentally impossible for Earth-based instruments. This\nparagraph was removed from the final version at the request\nof strict censorship in the USSR of all topics dealing with\nspace exploration at that time. The latter was independently\nconfirmed to the author in four private communications by\nLev A. Lebedev (1987), Gennady Sholomitsky (1991), Niko-\nlai Kardashev (2016) and Leonid Matveenko (2018). So, if\none takes into account this first mention of Space VLBI in the\nfirst half of 1960s, by now, the topic does have a respectable\nhistory.\nIn the case of reflecting antennas (in a widely used pro-\nfessional slang – “dishes”), the resolution is defined by the\ndiffraction limit, λ/D, where λ is a wavelength, and D – a\ndiameter of the reflector, just as is the case in the “traditional”\noptical astronomy. For typical in radio domain decimeter to\nmeter wavelengths, affordable dishes of tens of meters in\ndiameter can reach the angular resolution of tens of minutes\nof arc, far worse than a typical angular resolution of Earth-\nbased optical telescopes, which is of the order of a second\nof arc. A concept of interferometers was introduced in radio\nastronomy in the beginning of the 1950s [4, chapter 5]. It\nenabled radio astronomers to sharpen the angular resolution\ndefined by the same simple formula mentioned above, with\na substitution of the antenna diameter with the projection on\nthe image plane of the baseline connecting two elements of\nthe interferometer. Later, in the second half of the 1960s,\nthe concept of radio interferometry got its ultimate extension\nto the baselines comparable to the Earth diameter. This led\nto the introduction of VLBI mentioned above. VLBI offers\na breathtaking sharpness of viewing reaching microarcsec-\nonds. However, very soon radio astronomers realised that this\ntechnique has its limits: there are celestial radio sources that\nremained point-like (unresolved) even in observations with the\nglobal VLBI arrays the size of our planet. As is clear from\nthe simple formula at the beginning of this paragraph, the\nonly solution of getting an even sharper resolution at a given\nwavelength than achievable with the baseline comparable to\nthe Earth diameter is to place at least one element of an\ninterferometer in space, i.e, creating a Space VLBI (SVLBI)\nsystem.\nII. PREHISTORY OF SVLBI\nOnce the idea of radio interferometers larger than the planet\nhad been pronounced, several project studies took off in\nEurope, USA and USSR in the 1970s (see a brief review\nof the state of affairs in these activities as of 1984 in [5]).\nAmong various engineering components of these projects, the\nemphasis was placed on the antennas of spaceborne VLBI\nelements. Some of these studies were rather futuristic, like\nthe “infinitely expandable speceborne radio telescope” [6]\nwhich, in modern terms, can be called a square kilometre\ntelescope in space. At the other end of the antenna-size\nscale was a proposal to use a ∼3-m communication antenna\nof the proposed NASA Venusian mission VOIR as a VLBI\nantenna during the mission’s cruise phase, thus operating with\nbaselines ranging from several to ∼100 million km [7].\nSeveral early SVLBI studies proceeded to advanced stages\nand played important roles in providing inputs into later\nprojects that resulted in operational SVLBI missions. Ar-\nguably, among these advanced studies the most prominent\nwere the following three:\narXiv:2306.17647v1  [astro-ph.IM]  30 Jun 2023\n\n1) Quasat, a joint ESA–NASA study of an orbiting ∼15-\nm radio telescope for imaging SVLBI observations at\ndm–cm wavelengths with angular resolution sharper by\na factor of 3–5 compared to global Earth-based systems\n[8]. The project was under study in the first half of the\n1980s and reached the ESA Phase A study [9].\n2) RACSAS (Radio Astronomical Space System for Aper-\nture Synthesis), a Soviet project of a low-orbit VLBI\nsynthesis system with a 30-m spaceborne radio telescope\nKRT-30, which was under development from the late\n1970s through the 1980s [10, section 7.3.3]. The KRT-30\ntelescope was designed as a multi-task facility for remote\nsensing and radio astronomy for potential deployment in\nspace by the Soviet spaceplane Buran [11, p. 383], an\nanalogue of the US Space Shuttle.\n3) IVS (International VLBI Satellite), a joint project study\nby ESA, NASA and Soviet Space Agency in the second\nhalf of the 1980s [12]. It was an ambitious project of a\n25-m speceborne telescope capable to observe as a VLBI\nelement at wavelengths from 6 cm down to 1.5 mm from\na range of orbits with a varying apogee from 20,000 km\nto 150,000 km.\nNone of the above projects has materialised. But many com-\nponents of design studies of hard- and soft-ware of these\nprojects found their way into real SVLBI systems which began\noperations in the middle of the 1980s. The early studies also\nserved as a “training ground” for the human workforce of the\nimplemented SVLBI missions in the following decades.\nIII. SPACE VLBI BECOMES A REALITY\nA. First SVLBI “fringes”\nThe first ad hoc experimental demonstration of SVLBI was\nconducted with the NASA’s geostationary Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite System (TDRSS) in 1986 [13], Fig. 1. Its\ngeostationary satellite was equipped with two 4.9 m antennas,\none of which was used in this demonstration as a radio\ntelescope. The observations were conducted at 13 cm and\n2 cm together with a network of large Earth-based antennas\nin Australia, Japan and the US.\n[\nFig. 1.\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite of the 1st generation, an artist’s\nimpression. Credit: NASA.\nThe space-borne component of this first SVLBI system was\nnot designed as a radio telescope, and was not supposed to\noperate as such. It was the ingenuity of the NASA engineers\nthat made possible re-configuring and re-programming the on-\nboard instrumentation making it compatible with the Earth-\nbased VLBI radio telescope and data processing systems.\nThe main achievement of the TDRSS Orbital VLBI experi-\nment was an experimental confirmation of the feasibility of\nobtaining an interferometric response (so called “interfero-\nmetric fringes”) on baselines exceeding the Earth diameter\nand involving a radio telescope not fixed on the surface\nof Earth. The maximum projected baseline achieved in the\ndemonstration was ∼2.2 Earth diameters (ED). It has to be\nnoted that the sensitivity of an interferometer to a source’s\nbrightness, traditionally measured in radio astronomy in de-\ngrees Kelvin (of a hypothetic black body’s temperature of the\nsame brightness as the source) depends on the physical length\nof the projected baseline. In other words, the source can be\nresolved with a given baseline only up to a certain brightness\ntemperature. If the brightness temperature is higher for a given\ntotal flux density of the source, a longer baseline is needed\nto resolve the source’s image. The TDRSS Orbital VLBI\nexperiment indicated that in several quasars the brightness\ntemperature is higher than can be measured with Earth-based\nVLBI arrays.\nB. Muses-B, VSOP, HALCA: the first dedicated operational\nSVLBI facility\nIn the wake of the success of the TDRSS VLBI demon-\nstration experiment, the VLBI Space Observatory Program\n(VSOP) was conceived at the Institute of Space and As-\ntronautical Science in Japan in the end of the 1980s [14].\nAlthough the project was formally aimed primarily at testing\nthe new four-stage solid fuel rocket M-V and new satellite\nplatform, christened HALCA (Highly Advanced Laboratory\nfor Communication and Astronomy) after the launch on 12\nFebruary 1997, it did have a core science program focused on\nSVLBI experiments.\n[\nFig. 2.\nThe HALCA antenna deployment test at the Institute of Space and\nAstronautical Sciences. Credit: ISAS/JAXA.\n\nThe main component of the mission was the space-borne\nradio telescope with a parabolic reflector of 8.8 m effective\ndiameter, Fig. 2. Its surface was formed by a gold-coated\nmolybdenum wire mesh. Three receivers enabled observations\nat 18, 6 and 1.3 cm in left-hand circular polarisation (LCP).\nThe satellite was on a medium eccentricity orbit with the\napogee of about 22,000 km above Earth and orbital period\nof about 6 hrs. The mission had a sizeable involvement\nof international community coordinated by a group called\nVISC (VSOP International Science Council). Among other\nthings, VISC coordinated such mission implementation issues\nas operation of five dedicated Earth-based tracking and data\nacquisition stations (one each in Australia, Japan and Spain,\nplus two stations in the US), orbit determination, VLBI data\nprocessing, Earth-based VLBI network arrangements and the\npolicy for access to the mission by the worldwide science\ncommunity.\nVSOP operated with the aggregate data rate of 128 Mbit/s –\nthe highest sustainable data downlink rate of a space science\nmission at the time. The signal coherency – the major require-\nment of a VLBI system – was supported by a phase-locked\nloop (PLL), fed by a hydrogen maser frequency standard\nat a tracking station. Two of the three observing bands, 18\nand 6 cm, operated successfully. The signal in the third, the\nhighest frequency band of 1.35 cm, had a very high system\nnoise, preventing science operations. It is believed that the\nreason was damage to the waveguide of this band due to a\nhigh level of vibration during the satellite launch. Three data\nprocessing (correlation) facilities supported the mission. They\nwere located at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observa-\ntory in Penticton, Canada; National Astronomical Observatory\nof Japan in Mitaka, Japan; and National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory in Socorro, NM, USA. The HALCA satellite\noperated for six years until 2003 and was switched off after\nits attitude control reaction wheels stopped operating after\nexceeding their warranty period significantly.\nThe VSOP HALCA mission provided a wealth of observa-\ntional material on continuum (both 18 cm and 6 cm wave-\nlengths) and hydroxyl spectral line observations at 18 cm on\ncompact structures of galactic and extragalactic radio sources\nat the hitherto unchartered sub-milliarcsecond angular scale.\nThe mission was highly acclaimed: it was awarded with the\nTeam Achievement Award of the International Academy of\nAstronautics in 2005.\nC. RadioAstron\nThe next and so far the only other first-generation SVLBI\nmission is the Russian-led RadioAstron [15]. The project was\nconceived in the late 1970s at the Space Research Institute\nof the USSR Academy of Sciences and was launched from\nBaikonur on a Zenit-2SB rocket and a Fregat booster stage\non 18 July 2011. The Astro Space Center of the Lebedev\nPhysical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and\nthe Lavochkin Science and Production Association led the\nmission.\n[\nFig. 3.

Credit: Lavochkin Science and Productions Association.\nThe main component of the RadioAstron’s science payload\nwas the 10-m parabolic reflector formed by 27 carbon-fibre\npetals and a central circular part, Fig. 3. The telescope was\nequipped with four radio astronomy dual-polarisation (both\nleft- and right-hand, LCP and RCP) for the wavelengths 92,\n18, 6 and 1.3 cm. The satellite operated on a highly eccentric\nevolving orbit with its apogee reaching the distance of 350,000\nkm from Earth (∼28 ED) and with an orbital period of about\n9 days. Just as VSOP did, RadioAstron was able to use a highly\nstable heterodyne signal of an Earth-based hydrogen maser\nfrequency standard through a PLL. However, the RadioAstron\nspacecraft also carried two active Hydrogen maser standards.\nOne of these devices was used as the prime provider of the\nhighly stable heterodyne signal for 6 years, twice longer than\nthe warranty period, from the launch until July 2017. Just as\nin the case of VSOP, RadioAstron had a large involvement of\ninternational community in its mission operational and science\ncomponents. Similarly to VSOP, the RadioAstron International\nScience Council (RISC) coordinated the global international\ninvolvement in the mission. The Earth-based support was pro-\nvided by two data acquisition stations in Pushchino (Russia)\nand Green Bank (WV, USA). They received the raw VLBI\ndata stream from the satellite with the data rate of 128 Mbit/s\nin the same data format as VSOP. The RadioAstron VLBI\ndata were processed at three correlators operated at the Astro\nSpace Center in Moscow (Russia), Max-Plank-Institut f¨ur\nRadioastronomie in Bonn (Germany) and Joint Institute for\nVLBI ERIC in Dwingeloo (The Netherlands).\nAfter completion of the in-orbit checkout and verification,\nthe mission has become open to the worldwide science com-\nmunity under the “open sky” access policy. The RadioAstron\nmission has issued 6 Calls for Science Proposals, each cov-\nering one operational year. Due to the achievable baselines\nreaching 28 ED, the RadioAstron mission has established an-\ngular resolution records in all four operational bands, and the\n\nabsolute record of about 7 microarcseconds at the shortest\nobserving wavelength of 1.3 cm. The mission was completed\nin 2019, after operating in orbit nearly 7.5 years, 2.5 times\nlonger than the industrial warranty of the spacecraft.\nIV. SVLBI LEGACY\nThe two first-generation SVLBI missions, VSOP and Ra-\ndioAstron, which followed the first demonstration SVLBI\nexperiment with TDRSS, created a solid technological basis\nfor fur"
