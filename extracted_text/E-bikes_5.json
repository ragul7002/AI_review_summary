Imbalance occurs when bikers cannot drop off or pick-up a bike because the bike station is either full or empty [5-9]. To overcome the limitation of the dock-based BSS, a new generation of BSSs was introduced in China in 2015—the dock-less (or station-free) BSS takes an approach in which the BSS does not have stations. Rather, bikes (or e-bikes) are distributed along city sidewalks. People can rent a bike from anywhere and leave it within a defined zone instead of certain location (“stations”). \nIn 2012, a modern mode of transportation (micromobility); the e-scooter network debuted along with (and sometimes competitively) the dockless bike-sharing system and thrived in 2017. This system works similarly as the bike-sharing system, yet with e-scooter instead of a bike. With more than two million users, the e-scooter sharing system has entered more than 80 city schemes since 2017 [10]. In 2018, the e-scooter system has exceeded both dock-less and dock-based bike sharing system as shown in FIGURE 1. This increased usage of e-scooter system compared to other public transportation systems has gained policymakers and investors’ attention to investigate so that they better ensure safety, management and operation. \nLimited regulation and lack of awareness of the risks involved in using these micromobility transportation modes raises numerous safety concerns. For example, a U.S. national database showed that facial and head injuries from micro-mobility devices have tripled over the \n5 \nlast 10 years [11]. This study found that the number of incidents climbed from 2,325 in 2008 to 6,957 in 2018, 66% of those treated were not wearing helmets. Another study in Los Angeles and Santa Monica found that e-scooters have been associated with 249 emergency room visits between September 1, 2017 and the end of August 2018 [12]. In this paper, we investigate the users’ behavior of e-scooter and dock-less e-bike sharing system. We investigate how average trip speed change depending on the day of the week and the time of the day using publicly available dataset collected in the city of Austin in Texas State, U.S. for the years of 2018-2019. \n**==> picture [334 x 213] intentionally omitted <==**\n**FIGURE 1  Trips taken by station-based, scooter-based, and dockless systems.** \n## **RELATED WORK** \n6 \nBuck et al. studied the demographic of BSS users and traditional cyclists in Washington, D.C. [15].  The authors found the user demographic to be mostly white, around 80% for both traditional and BSS cyclists. Compared to the overall Washington D.C. population, the population of black people is slightly higher than white people (by 5%). However, none of the aforementioned research efforts has conducted temporal analysis of BSSs such as the speed of the bikers with respect to a time event. \n7 \nhouseholds in Chicago. \nNocerino et al. analyzed and tested the performance of both electric bicycles and electric scooters for delivering goods in seven European countries. They mainly investigated the possibility of replacing the traditional freight transport service and reducing CO2 emissions and energy savings in urban areas. Degele et al. studied the pattern usage of e-scooter in Germany. They concluded that the use of e-scooter sharing system can be grouped into four segments based on: age, time between rides, distance driven, and revenue per customer. They categorized into four groups: demographic, geographic, behavior, and psychographic. However, none of the above research efforts has considered comparing the behavior of e-scooter to bike sharing systems users. A few studies have been conducted to compare the pattern usage of e-scooter to dockbased bike sharing systems [26-28].  McKenzie conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of e-scootersharing and dock-based bike-sharing usage patterns in Washington, DC. He found there is a remarkable difference between the two systems in terms of the usage. One of which is bikes are used to commute for work while e-scooters are not. However, the comparison here is not fair given the bike-sharing system requires users to leave bikes in certain locations (“stations”) unlike e- scooter-sharing systems. Fawcett et al. attempted to analyze the e-bicycle and e-scooter-sharing systems with a focus on safety risks [27]. They suggested tips for operators and investors on how they can manage to overcome these risks. However, they did not study and analyze the users’ behavior of both systems with respect to the operational aspect: temporal analysis. \n## **DATA SET** \nThis study used a dataset that was collected in the city of Austin, Texas and is publicly available by the City of Austin [29]. The dataset contains about 6 million trips taken by users for either e- bikes or e-scooters from December 3, 2018 to May 20, 2019. Each trip is represented in a row and \n8 \neach of which has 18 features: trip ID, device ID, vehicle type (e-scooter or e-bike), trip duration (in seconds), trip distance (in meter), start time of the trip, end time of the trip, month, hour, day of week, year, council district (both start and end), and census tract (both start and end). In our analysis, we included the trips that meets the following criteria: (1) trip distance greater than or equal to .1 miles and less than 500 miles, and (2) trip duration less than 24 hours. TABLE 1 shows the total number of e-scooter and e-bikes that operators in the city. \n**TABLE 1 List of operators licensed to serve in Austin.** \n|**Operator**|**Scooters**|**Bikes**|\n|---|---|---|\n|Bird|4500|0|\n|JUMP|2500|2000|\n|Lime|5000|0|\n|Lyft|2000|0|\n|OjO|100|0|\n|Skip|500|0|\n|Spin|500|0|\n|VeoRide|300|50|\nComparing the usage pattern of e-scooters and dockless e-bikes is important to operators and investors so they can ensure their safety and identify the role that these play in a multi-modal transport system. In this study, we analyze an evolving dataset of e-scooter and dockless e-bike usage patterns in Austin, TX from December 3, 2018 to May 20, 2019. For each of the day-ofweek and time-of-day, we (1) started the analysis by determining the number of clusters to be used in the dataset using the CC technique; (2) applied the CA-based clustering algorithm to cluster the usage pattern of e-scooters and dockless e-bikes based on the outcome of the first step; and (3) tested the null hypothesis that the usage pattern of the dataset for each case are samples from continuous distributions with equal medians, against the alternative hypothesis that they are not using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. \n**Day-of-week** \n11 \n**==> picture [446 x 206] intentionally omitted <==**\n**----- Start of picture text -----**<br>\n(a)  (b)<br>**----- End of picture text -----**<br>\n**FIGURE 3 Consensus index value for different clusters for (a) e-bikes, and (b) e-scooters.** \n**==> picture [443 x 366] intentionally omitted <==**\n**----- Start of picture text -----**<br>\n(a)  (b)<br>**----- End of picture text -----**<br>\n12 \n## **FIGURE 4 Clusters of day-of-week for (a) e-bikes, and (b) e-scooters.** \n**TABLE 2 Mean and standard deviation of each clusters for e-bikes and e-scooters.** \n**==> picture [272 x 184] intentionally omitted <==**\n**----- Start of picture text -----**<br>\nCluster Color  Mean ( 𝒎/𝒔 )  Std ( 𝒎/𝒔 )<br>E-Bikes<br>Orange  3.01 1.38<br>Blue  3.44 1.31<br>E-Scooters<br>Orange  2.55 1.19<br>Blue  2.32 1.25<br>**----- End of picture text -----**<br>\n**Time-of-day** \nthe consensus index value for different clusters for the dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for the timeof-day data.

First, this study could be implemented to data from different geographical locations in the U.S., as this was the only data available of this kind to the best of our knowledge. A different dataset from different locations in U.S. could further leverage this study to increase its veracity.

  "introduction": "Due to the large increase in vehicles on the road over the years, cities face challenges in providing high-quality transportation services. Traffic jams are a clear sign that cities are overwhelmed, and that current transportations networks and systems cannot accommodate the current demand without a change in policy, infrastructure, transportation modes, and commuters’ choice of transportation mode. Previous research have shown that drivers are more likely to use their personal cars or even the ridesharing services very often for short-distance trips, compared to long ones [1]. For example, Uber's ride lengths (and private car trips) in the US are skewed towards the low en d, which means that Uber rides are more likely to be short (< 5 mi). Consequently, microtransport modes such as e-scooter-sharing systems will replace about 50 percent of Uber trips. \nAs an effort to support micro-transportation modes such as bicycling and offering alternative transportation modes, Bike-sharing dock-based systems (BSSs) were implemented in more than 50 countries [2]. Through distributing bicycles from stations distributed across a service area, BSSs seek to inspire people to travel through bike. People can borrow and return a bicycle from any station around their destination. Bicycles are considered an affordable, easy-to-use, and, healthy transportation mode, and BSSs show significant transportation, environment, and health benefits. \nIn transportation, BSSs replace privately-owned car trips with bicycling, thereby mitigating traffic jams in the city. A survey conducted by McNeil at al. found that 80% or more of BSS users said they use BSSs for shopping/errands, social/recreational, trips to and from public transit, and commute trips [3], confirming that BSSs are becoming a reliable and convenient transportation mode for both recreational and non-recreational trips. In the environmental and \n4",
