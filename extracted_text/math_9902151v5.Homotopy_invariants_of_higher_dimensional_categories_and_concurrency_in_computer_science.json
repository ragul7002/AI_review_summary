  "abstract": "The strict globular ω-categories formalize the execution paths of a parallel automa-\nton and the homotopies between them. One associates to such (and any) ω-category C\nthree homology theories. The ﬁrst one is called the globular homology. It contains the\noriented loops of C. The two other ones are called the negative (resp.",

Let C be a globular ω-category. For any strictly positive natural number\nn and any j between 1 and n, there exists one and only one natural map +j from the set\nof pairs (x, y) of N □(C)n × N □(C)n such that ∂+\nj (x) = ∂−\nj (x) to the set N □(C)n which\nsatisﬁes the following properties :\n∂−\nj (x +j y) = ∂−\nj (x)\n(1)\n∂+\nj (x +j y) = ∂+\nj (x)\n(2)\n∂α\ni (x +j y) =\n(∂α\ni (x) +j−1 ∂α\ni (y) if i < j\n∂α\ni (x) +j ∂α\ni (y) if i > j\n(3)\nMoreover, these operations induce a structure of cubical ω-category on N □(C).\nProof.",

  "conclusion": ".\nWe are in position to prove the proposition :\nProposition 3.4. For any ω-category C, the equality Hgl\n∗(C) ∼= L∗(H)(Gl(C)) holds.\nProof. If M is a globular group, we introduce the complex of abelian groups (Cgl\n∗(M), ∂gl)\ndeﬁned as follows : Cgl\n0 (M) = M0 ⊕M0 and for n ⩾1, Cgl\nn (M) = Mn, with the diﬀerential\nmap ∂gl(x) = (s(x), t(x)) if x ∈M1 and ∂gl(x) = s(x) −t(x) if x ∈Mn with n ⩾2. We\nhave H0(Cgl\n∗(M), ∂) = H(M).\nLet k be a natural number and let L be a free abelian\ngroup. If p > 0, let us prove that Hp(Cgl\n∗(k!(L))) = 0.",
