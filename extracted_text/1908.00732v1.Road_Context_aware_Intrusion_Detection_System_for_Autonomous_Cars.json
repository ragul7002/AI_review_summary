  "abstract": "—Security is of primary importance to vehicles. The\nviability of performing remote intrusions onto the in-vehicle net-\nwork has been manifested. In regard to unmanned autonomous\ncars, limited work has been done to detect intrusions for\nthem while existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) embrace\nlimitations against strong adversaries. In this paper, we consider\nthe very nature of autonomous car and leverage the road context\nto build a novel IDS, named Road context-aware IDS (RAIDS).\nWhen a computer-controlled car is driving through continuous\nroads, road contexts and genuine frames transmitted on the car’s\nin-vehicle network should resemble a regular and intelligible\npattern. RAIDS hence employs a lightweight machine learning\nmodel to extract road contexts from sensory information (e.g.,\ncamera images and distance sensor values) that are used to gener-\nate control signals for maneuvering the car.",

  "conclusion": "Security is always critical for trafﬁc vehicles. In this paper,\nwe investigate how to effectively detect intrusions to the in-\nvehicle communications of autonomous car. In an unmanned\nautonomous car, a self-driving model reads sensory informa-\ntion reﬂecting dynamic road contexts and generates control\n\nsignals that are eventually transformed into frames transmitted\non the CAN bus. The ever-changing control signals at runtime\nrequire the involvement of road contexts in detecting intrusions\nfor autonomous car. We accordingly develop RAIDS.",
