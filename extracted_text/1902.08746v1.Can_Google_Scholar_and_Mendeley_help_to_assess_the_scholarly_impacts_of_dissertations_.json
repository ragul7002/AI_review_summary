  "introduction": "Doctoral dissertations are important single-authored scholarly works written by early career researchers \nand form a significant minority of the scientific output of universities. For instance, according to the British \nLibrary EThOS service (https://ethos.bl.uk/), 1,114 doctoral theses were awarded by the University of \nCambridge in 2015, in comparison to 8,174 Scopus-indexed journal articles. Doctoral theses usually \ninclude a comprehensive",

They are \nassessed by independent examiners before being published, and so could be described as peer-reviewed. \nDissertations may make substantial contributions to scholarship or professional practice in some fields, \nsuch as for supporting clinical practice (McLeod & Weisz, 2004). Citations to dissertations may also be \nimportant impact evidence for early career researchers since they may have had too little time to have \njournal articles published (ACUMEN Consortium, 2014). This would be particularly relevant for job \napplications but may also impact early promotion decisions or grant applications.",
  "methodology": "This section introduces a practical method to systematically identify Google Scholar citations to \ndissertations for large scale evaluations from the ProQuest Dissertation & Theses database. Because \nGoogle Scholar does not support automatic API searches, a new method is introduced using the Publish \nor Perish software (Harzing & van der Wal, 2008) with pre-defined queries to limit searches to ProQuest \ndissertations in a manageable manner. All data collection was conducted during November 2018. \n4.1 Google Scholar queries for ProQuest dissertations    \nTo search Google Scholar for citations to ProQuest doctoral dissertations a combination of the site: search \ncommand, phrase searches, and the author: search command was used and the",
  "results": "of the above two studies, it is possible that a greater proportion of scholarly outputs \ncite theses but these citations form a smaller fraction of all citations, with citation lists expanding over the \nsame period. These studies also show that it is possible to extract information about citations to theses \nfrom the Web of Science and Scopus but this information does not include citations from other \ndissertations and most books and seems to be more useful to assess overall citation pattern to all \ndissertations rather than to individual theses. Moreover, neither method could guarantee comprehensive \ncoverage of any collection of dissertations. Google Scholar has the potential to address at least the former \nissue since it indexes dissertations, books and preprints. \nPrevious Google Scholar studies have shown that it can locate citations to non-standard publications, such \nas gray literature (Orduna-Malea, Martín-Martín, & López-Cózar, 2017) and books (Kousha, Thelwall, & \nRezaie, 2011).",

  "conclusion": "The method introduced by this paper is the first attempt to investigate the citation impact of dissertations \non a large-scale through Google Scholar, making it more practical for universities, departments, employers \nor funders of doctoral research to assess the scholarly influence of doctoral research or junior researchers. \nThis will not be useful for most individual researchers since most dissertations are uncited, but can help \nlarge scale evaluations of doctoral programmes or doctoral funding initiatives. Such evaluations should \nalso take into account the impact of journal articles and other publications derived from dissertations as \nwell as the extent of self-citations to dissertations (e.g., 22% in this study). Whilst this study has focused \non ProQuest dissertations, similar methods should work for other online repositories that allow full text \nindexing in Google Scholar. Although Google Scholar can now be used for large scale evaluations of the \nimpact of dissertations, a limitation is that the coverage of the method may be low.",
  "references": "searches in conventional \ncitation indexes have also been used to assess citations to theses or dissertations by searching for related \nterms (e.g., *thesis* or *dissertation*) in the reference sections of other scholarly publications (Larivière, \nZuccala, & Archambault, 2008; Rasuli, Schöpfel, & Prost, 2018). This method is useful to estimate the total \nnumber of citations to all dissertations rather than to individual doctoral dissertations across different \nfields, institutions or years. Moreover, using conventional citation databases for this purpose could be \nproblematic in the social sciences and arts and humanities, where poorly-indexed books and publications \nin languages other than English could be important (Archambault et al., 2006; Huang & Chang, 2008). \nGoogle Scholar is not primarily a citation index for dissertations, but automatically indexes dissertations \nfrom many institutional repositories, databases and commercial publisher websites and reports counts of \ncitations to them based on its indexed publications. By November 2018, Google Scholar had indexed the \nmetadata or text of 264,0002 UK doctoral dissertations from The British Library EThOS service, which is \nthe UK’s national database of doctoral theses (https://ethos.bl.uk/) and 323,0003 French Ph.D."
