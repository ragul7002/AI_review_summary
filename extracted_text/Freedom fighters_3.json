We imagine that the ball begins at 1800 K – not too unbelievable – and that the air\noutside is at 300 K. Essentially, we are treating the ball as a sort of \"onion.\" We assume that nothing ever\ncrosses from one onion-layer to another. Any air molecule or free electron that starts in a given shell stays\nthere forever. Heat is only given to the innermost 20 shells. The 31st element of the set is a 'dummy element'\nthat is only used to index time throughout the simulation. We guess that the initial radius is 2 cm. This may\nseem a little large for a candle flame. But we should recall that a significant amount of very hot air surrounds\nwhat our eye sees as the flame. Smaller flames can be modeled. They do not, however, achieve a size or\nbrightness consistent with what we usually see in our ovens.\nWe first act on _K_ with a 'Source Operator' which adds the proper amount of temperature to each layer of\nthe onion and subtracts the loss due to continuum radiation (usually insignificant). After this a 'Diffusion\nOperator' acts upon it doing two things. Firstly, it redistributes the temperatures according to ordinary thermal\ndiffusion. Then it adds one time increment to the 'dummy' 31st set. Lastly an operator rearranges the coordinates of the onion-layers so that expansion is accounted for – if, say, the temperature inside a particular layer\nhappened to increase, the separation between that layer's walls would have to increase as well. These operators execute over a time step small enough that the solution is stable and accurate. We combine these three\nsequential processes into one 'Evolution Operator' which is iterated upon K as many times as necessary to\ncover the time interval of interest. The details are laid out in the Supplementary Material. Having estimated\nthe candle flame as being about 1800 K we have only to figure out _I_ 0. The pattern of microwaves inside a\ntypical oven has been simulated (5). The strongest fields can exceed 25,000 V/m. Also, as standing waves are\nset up, energy can impinge on the ball from both sides. We will guess that _I_ 0 = 10 [6] W/ _m_ [2] . This may be",
  "introduction": "The mysterious appearance of \"Foo Fighters\" over the skies of World War II, and their equally mysterious\ndisappearance after the cessation of hostilities, constitutes one of the stranger episodes in the history of atmospheric physics (1). Bright lights were reported to follow aircraft. They were observed in all theaters of the\nwar. Common opinion on most sides held that they were enemy secret weapons or UFOs. Little evidence\nindicating this surfaced following the end of the war and they were variously explained as corona discharges,\nball lightning, or other electromagnetic or optical phenomena.\nThe idea that these lights were produced by radar beams interacting with ionized gas, particularly engine\nexhaust, is not new. An interesting video suggesting as much is easily found on the Internet (2). But the provenance of this notion is difficult to trace and it does not seem to have attracted much physical attention. For a\nphenomenon such as that described to have been real it would have had to have an input of energy (or be an\nactual UFO). Very few sources of external energy, save radar energy emitted by the aircraft itself would have\nbeen present to account for a glowing object. We would like to investigate this idea and find out whether, and\nunder what circumstances, it might be plausible.\n## 2. Microwave Oven Plasma Balls.",
  "results": "rises to the top surface of the oven and dissipates. What could be occurring here? Surprisingly, little theoretical work seems to have gone into analyzing this common phenomenon. Das (3) has tried to describe it in\nterms of Townsened avalanches (although the electric field strengths involved do not seem to easily justify\nthis). We will take a far simpler approach.\nSuppose there is a free electron oscillating in a microwave field. It moves according to:\n1) _me_ x''(t) + Λ x'(t) = _e E_ Sin(Ω t) = F(t)\nwhere Λ represents a damping constant that describes the interaction of the electron with the air it is moving\nthrough. We can estimate Λ by considering Paschen's work on the electrical breakdown of air at STP (4). He\n**2** _FooFighter2.nb_\nfinds that the average distance traveled between electron collisions with air molecules is, roughly, 10 [�][6] m.\nKnowing this we can estimate Λ - 10 [�][19] [kg]\nsec [. Realizing that the electron gives energy to its surrounding gas at]\na rate x'(t) F(t) we find that the gas takes up energy at a rate:\nΗ _e e_ [2]                    - _E_ [2] Λ\n2)  Rate energy in (W/ _m_ [3] ) =\n[2] [2]\nΗ _e e_ [2]  - _E_ [2] Λ\n2 � _me_ [2] Ω [2] �Λ [2] - [�] [Η] _[e][ e]_ 2 [ 2] Λ [�] _[E]_ [2]\n[�]\n2 Λ where Η _e_ is the number density of free electrons. Ω is\nassumed to be about 10 [9] -10 [10] sec [�][1] since this is typical for a kitchen microwave oven.\nNow, assuming that each gas molecule possesses an energy Β k T, we can write the rate of temperature\nincrease as:\nΗ _e e_ [2]          - _E_ [2]\n3)  � _t T_ - _t_ - - 2 Η _A_ Β _k_ Λ [ where ][Η] _[A]_ [ represents the number density of air molecules. ][Β][ is set at 3.5, as is proper for]\ndiatomic molecules at high temperature.\nThe pressure of the air is taken to always be 1 atm ( _P_ 0 = 101,325 N/ _m_ [2] ). We will picture our nascent plasma\nball having a radius _d_ 0 and containing a fixed number of free electrons. We cannot be sure what this number\nis but, for simplicity's sake, we will assume their total number to be more-or-less constant. We will assume\nthat all the air molecules inside our plasma ball stay there forever and we will write their number as _N_ 0. As\nour ball heats it will, of course, expand. Η _e_ and Η _A_ will change equally. Λ may be designated Λ0 _T_ 0/T(t) where\n_T_ 0 is about 273 K. (As the ball expands the electrons will collide less often and Λ will decrease as 1/volume.)\nTherefore:\nΗ _e e_ [2]         - _E_ [2] _T_         - _t_         4)  � _t T_ - _t_ - - 2 Η _A_ Β _k_ Λ0 _T_ 0 [.]\nIt is not clear what Η _e_ really is. But we know that there are free electrons in candle flames since these can\nconduct electricity somewhat. We do know that a candle flame can easily be up to 1800 K in places, however.\n_E_ is more difficult to estimate because of the complexity of the situation within the oven. A pattern of standing\nwaves is set up and the field can be very strong in some places and weak in others. We know that a microwave oven projects about 1 kW of energy through a roughly .07 _m_ [2] area. So _E_ - 3250 V/m on average. The\nintensity of this radiation would be about 14,000 W/ _m_ [2] . One of two thingscan happen. If Η _e_ is very small,\nnothing happens. If Η _e_ is sufficiently great the little ball will heat exponentially in real time. If Η _e_ = 6.5 X10 [16]\n_m_ [�][3] (corresponding to about 1.5X10 [�][6] % ionization) it will heat to 8, 000 _[o]_ in 1 sec! But we should also bear\nin mind that, as the temperature increases, Η _e_ will increase due to simple (Saha) ionization of the air. The net\ncatastrophes ever happen. Why not? For one thing, the plasma ball (being very hot and buoyant) quickly rises\nto the top of the oven compartment where it dissipates. But, more importantly, there is only so much energy\nan oven can give to such a ball. Suppose our ball of candle flame began with a radius of 2 cm. If Η _e_ exceeds a\ncritical level the above model would have it taking up energy at a rate greater than _I_ 0 Area = _I_ 0 Π �2�cm� [2]\nwhere _I_ 0 designate the radiation intensity impinging on the ball. This is, of course, quite impossible. Since _I_ 0 =\nΕ0 _c E_ [2]\nwe see that the critical electron density is defined by:\n2\n_FooFighter2.nb_ **3**\n5)  Η _e_ - [3][ Λ][0] _[ c]_ [ Ε][0] _[ T]_ [0]\n4 _e_ [2] _T d_ [ which is independent of ] _[I]_ [0][. ] _[T]_ [0][ = 300 and ][Λ][0][ is the damping at STP.]\nThis gives a critical density of 6.5X10 [16] - _m_ [�][3] for a 2 cm ball and 1.3X10 [16] _m_ [�][3] for a larger one with a 10 cm\nradius, assuming these are at 1800 K. It is perhaps worth mentioning that, at these and higher electron densities, the plasma frequency is generally above the frequencies used by microwave ovens (and radars). Early in\nits life we suppose these free electrons are supplied primarily by the chemical reactions that power the flame.\nWith the temperature above about 4000-5000 K Saha ionization of the air would provide more than enough\nelectron density to sustain the process.\nIf Η _e_ is above the critical value the above-described heating mechanism cannot work and must be abandoned in favor of one where the heating occurs at a slower rate given by:\n6)  � _t T_ - _t_ - - Π _N d_ 0 Β [2] _I k_ 0 [ where ] _[d]_ [ is the radius of the expanding ball of ionized air and ] _[N]_ [0][ is the number of air]\nmolecules inside it.\nThis radius will be proportional to � _T_ - _t_ �� _TB_ - [1][�][3] where _TB_ is the initial temperature of the flame. Thus � _t T_ - _t_ - \n_T_ - _t_ - [2][�][3] and the ball will expand less quickly than it would according to Eqn 4). Indeed, we will suppose that Η _e_\nalways exceed the critical value. This assumption greatly simplifies our work. We write:\n7) � _t T_ - _t_ - - Π _N d_ 0 Β [2] _I k_ 0 [ inside the ball and 0 outside.]\nBut the temperature will also change owing to thermal diffusion. And, if hot enough, the ball (which we\nassume to be optically transparent) will cool owing to its emission of continuum radiation. Therefore:\n8) � _t T_ - _t_, _r_ - - Π _d_ [2] _I_ 0\n_[T]_ [�] _[t]_ [,] _[ r]_ [��] where _W_ - _T_ - _t_, _r_ �� represents the loss to radiation ( _[W]_\n_P_ 0 Β _m_\n_[W]_\n_m_ [3][ )]\nΠ _d_ [2] _I_ 0 [�][2] _[T(t)]_ [ - ] _[W]_ [�] _[T]_ [�] _[t]_ [,] _[ r]_ [��]\n_N_ 0 Β _k_ [ + ] _[D]_ [0] _[(T(t, r))]_ _P_ 0 Β\nand _D_ 0 _(T(t, r))_ the thermal diffusivity of the air ( _[m]_ [2]\nball.\n## 3.

By the time it\nreaches about 3500 K it will be quite visible. By the time it reaches 6000 K it will be glowing with the apparent intensity of an 45 Watt light bulb (assuming these are about 2% efficient (6)). Below we plot its temperature profile at t = .5 sec (Fig. 2). The ball achieves a maximum radius of about .03 _m_ .\nFig. 2\nThe temperature profile ( _K_ ) of an _d_ 0 = . 02 m, _I_ 0 = 10 [6] W/ _m_ [2] ball at t = .5 sec as a function of radial distance ( _m_ ).\n## 4. Foo Fighters.\nLet us apply what we have learned above to the, more interesting, problem of Foo Fighters. Situations in the\nskies over World War II differed quite a bit from those inside a microwave oven. But we do know that airplanes put out hot exhaust. Modern propeller-driven planes can put out exhaust at, at least, about 1500 K (7).\nWe will guess that the powerful, early, war planes put out exhaust at 1800 K (since we have, conveniently,\nalready used this number and, besides, it is as reasonable as any).\nThe primitive airborne interception radars in use at the time could generate as much as 250 kW in power\n(8). Some focused it using parabolic reflectors. Others utilized Yagi-Uda or other dipole antenna arrays (9).\nNot knowing the specifics, we will estimate that 250 kW went out over an area of roughly 1 _m_ [2] . (It cannot,\nreally, have been much larger or smaller for things to make practical sense.) These early radars did not pour\ntheir energy out in a continuous stream but, rather, delivered it in pulses. The pulse rate frequency could be as\nhigh as many hundred Hz. But the German Hohentwiel system operated at as low a frequency as 50 Hz (10).\nWe will just use 100 Hz as an illustrative and reasonable example. Different planes had, of course, different\nradar sets on board which they would use to scan for enemy aircraft. If a radar beam were to end up focused\nupon an area where the airplane was discharging hot, probably rather ionized, exhaust, a phenomenon similar\nto that already described might very well take place. A hot plasma ball might form which, for as long as it\nremained subject to the plane's radar, would grow and luminesce. Since an airplane's exhaust stream is much\n**6** _FooFighter2.nb_\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n100 200 300 400 500\nFig. 3\nThe calculated core temperature ( _K_ ) of an _d_ 0 = . 1 m, _I_ 0 = 2.5�X10 [5] W/ _m_ [2] ball as a function of time (msec).\nA concern may arise since the radar supplies energy to the ball in pulses whereas we are approximating it as a\ncontinuous stream of power. Simulations have been performed with the source turning off and on rapidly.\nplane. They would be spaced at 1 m intervals. As long as they remained in the radar beam they would continue to heat and grow. The ones closest to the plane would be small and cool. Those farther away would be\nlarge and bright. Obviously, such balls could not continue to grow forever; at some point one of three things\nwould happen: 1) The ball would simply convect away and dissipate. 2) The radar beam might move away\nfrom it thus depriving it of sustenance. Or, 3) so many balls might trail the plane that they, together, would\nabsorb all the energy put out by the transmitter. We cannot say much about the first two possibilities. But we\nknow that one of these balls has an area of about .03 _m_ [2] . If all the emitted energy from the plane covers a\nrough effective area of 1 _m_ [2] the maximum number of balls would be about 1/.03 = 33. We will use 35 since it\nis a more convenient number. So, out to about 35 m behind the plane, the air crew would see a string of lights\nwith the brightest being the farthest away. Beyond 35 m the lights would quickly die out and vanish. We plot\nthis situation below (Fig. 4).\n_FooFighter2.nb_ **7**\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n10 20 30 40 50\nFig. 4\nThe luminosity (W) of a string of _d_ 0 = . 1 m, _I_ 0 = 2.5�X10 [5] W/ _m_ [2] balls as a function of distance from aircraft (m).\nSo we do not think the air crews were observing a _single object_ . Instead, they were looking at something\nlike the still frames in a movie. The balls closest to the plane would be easily overlooked. They would probably focus their attention on the �5 very bright balls that would form a chain about 4-5 m long and 35 m\nbehind the plane. These would glow, collectively, with about 55 W (or the intensity of a 2750 W light bulb).\nDistance and confusion could easily lead them to perceive a single, large and bright, object that appeared to be\nchasing their plane. We suspect that this is what happened. The picture is, probably, complicated somewhat by\nthe fact that not all balls in such a string would have ignited or behaved identically.\nIt could be objected that we have had to use some pretty large values for _I_ 0 and _T_ both for the Foo Fighters\nand the microwave plasma balls. Our values, while not physically ridiculous, are, to be sure, \"generous.\" But\nFoo Fighters were not observed chasing all airplanes every day and not all candles perform well in the oven.\nSome rather fortuitous circumstances seem required for these phenomena to work. How a powerful radar\nbeam would be \"painting\" the balls behind an aircraft is hard to say. The previously mentioned video blames\n'overpowered' radar sets. This is certainly possible – malfunctions must have been common. Many airplanes\nhad radar that could scan off to the sides and behind so it may be that some air crews exacerbated their own\nproblem by trying to track the, seemingly dangerous, object that was pursuing them. In the process they would\nonly have encouraged its growth and bad behavior! We also wonder why Foo Fighters largely disappeared\nfollowing the end of the War. This may be due to the adoption of jet power – perhaps jet engines do not\nproduce suitable exhaust. Also, radar systems evolved becoming much more efficient and manageable.",
  "conclusion": "shown). It is remarkable how both this system, and its far smaller, oven-based, counterpart converge to the\nsame final temperature of about 6300 K. Once fully developed the plasma ball would glow with the apparent\nbrightness of a roughly 660 W incandescent light bulb. Now this is a bit below what we might like to see for a\nFoo Fighter. So we do not think this is all there is to it.\nWe have tried to show that the interaction of microwave energy with hot, ionized, air can very well produce\nthe kinds of phenomena encountered in our kitchen ovens and by World War II fliers. We have been able to\nestimate the circumstances that seem necessary and find these to be, generally, not too physically unrealistic. It\nmay be objected that our treatment of the heating mechanism for the ball is a bit simplistic and threadbare.\nThis is true. But the important point to remember is that the ball can never take up more energy than is incident upon it. We just assume it does the very best it can.\n## References.\n**8** _FooFighter2.nb_\n1)  See Wikipedia: Foo fighters.\n2)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjgorx612zw .\n3)  Das, K.
