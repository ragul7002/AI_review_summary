  "introduction": "Insulating materials that host localized spin degrees\nof freedom can exhibit complex ground states and fascinating low-temperature properties. This behavior frequently arises from competing interactions that cannot\nbe satisfied simultaneously. Prime examples are antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin couplings on frustrated\ngeometries like the two-dimensional (2D) triangular and\nkagome lattice or the three-dimensional (3D) pyrochlore\nlattice [1][–][3] . These systems are characterized by a large degeneracy of classical ground states. This often leads to\ncomplex states of matter and phase transitions if quantum or thermal fluctuations are present [4][–][6] .\nA triangular lattice geometry with antiferromagnetic\nspin couplings is realized in a large number of magnetic materials such as Cs2CuCl2 [7][–][9], Na _x_ CoO2 [10][,][11],\nNaCrO2 [12][,][13] and _α −_ NaFeO2 [14] . Another frustrated triangular material is the recently discussed cluster magnet\nLiZn2Mo3O8 [15][–][18] . Here, Mo3O13 clusters that carry a\ntotal spin _S_ = 1 _/_ 2 are arranged in two-dimensional triangular lattice planes that are weakly coupled along the\nthird dimension. Another lattice geometry that exhibits\nfrustration effects if further neighbor antiferromagnetic\ncouplings are present is the honeycomb lattice. This lattice is dual to the triangular lattice. It is realized in\nvarious solid-state compounds and can arise by replacing\none third of the magnetic ions in a triangular lattice system by a non-magnetic one. This is done, for example,\nin Na2Co2TeO6 or Na3Co2SbO6 [19] . Another recently discussed interesting honeycomb material is Na1 _−x_ NiSbO6,\nwhere magnetic Ni [2+] and Ni [3+] form a honeycomb lattice\nwith mixed spins _S_ = 1 _/_ 2 and _S_ = 1.\nHere, we study the situation where these two lattice geometries are combined and consider spins on a\nhoneycomb lattice that are antiferromagnetically coupled to spins situated on a triangular lattice. It has\nrecently been shown that such a setup shows intriguing order from disorder effects in the regime of weakly\ncoupled sublattices. There, an emergent Z6 degree of\nfreedom has been revealed that exhibits a sequence of\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions bracketing a critical phase [20][,][21] . Experimentally, such a sit\nuation might arise, for example, in the cluster magnet\nLiZn2Mo3O8 at low temperatures [18] or in a material such\nas Na1 _−x_ NiSbO6 by replacing the non-magnetic ion Sb\nby a magnetic one. The progress in chemical synthesis, in particular considering the approach of using small\nmagnetic clusters as basic units, might bring other experimental candidates in the future as well, possibly with a\nlarge spin _S >_ 1 _/_ 2.\nAnother experimental platform where classical frustrated magnetism has been investigated in recent years\nis based on cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices [22][,][23] .\nAt low temperatures and for weak interactions these systems form a superfluid and the atoms at site _i_ in the lattice have a well-defined local phase _φi_ . This local phase\ndegree of freedom can be interpreted as a classical planar (XY) spin �cos _φi,_ sin _φi_ �. Nearest-neighbor spins are\ncoupled via tunneling of atoms between the sites. For\nregular tunneling of atoms between the sites, the associated coupling between the planar spins is ferromagnetic.\nBy shaking the lattice in a periodic way, however, it is\npossible to add a non-zero Peierls phase to the tunneling\nelement. In this way, it is possible to induce a change\nin the sign of the tunneling element which leads to an\nantiferromagnetic coupling between the spins. Within\nthis approach, different links of the lattice can be ad\nFIG. 1. Windmill lattice. Left: The lattice may be thought\nof as a triangular lattice (red vertices) together with its dual\nhoneycomb lattice (blue vertices). The model has a three-site\nbasis.

Frustration effects have been experimentally observed on the triangular lattice via standard time-of-flight imaging [22] . Honeycomb optical lattice\ngeometries have also been realized in the past [24][,][25] .\nThis serves as our motivation to extensively study the\nclassical Heisenberg and the classical planar (XY) spin\nmodel on a lattice that combines both a honeycomb and a\ntriangular lattice. We refer to this lattice, which is shown\nin Fig. 1, as the “windmill lattice”. Considering antiferromagnetic interactions between all nearest-neighbor\npairs of spins, we determine the complete ground state\nphase diagram of both models. Due to competing interactions, the models turn out to show an extremely\nrich ground state phenomenology. For the Heisenberg\nmodel we find that next to phases where the spins order in a collinear or a coplanar fashion there exist also\nphases where the spins exhibit an intricate non-coplanar\nconfiguration where they arrange themselves into seperate double cones. In the windmill XY model those noncoplanar phases are replaced by other similarly involved\nconfigurations.\nThe structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows: in Sec. II we introduce the classical Heisenberg and\nplanar spin models on the windmill lattice, and in Sec. III",

In the appendices we provide the\ndetails on the calculation of all the ground state energies\nfrom the variational forms.\n**II.** **WINDMILL SPIN MODEL**\nThe windmill lattice that we study consists of a triangular lattice combined with its dual, honeycomb lattice. The windmill lattice can be described as a triangular Bravais lattice with a three-site basis per unit cell\ncontaining triangular, honeycomb _A_ and _B_ sites. The\nspins are positioned on the vertices of the lattice as shown\nin Fig. 1. We consider classical spins with an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between all nearest-neighbor\npairs of spins. The Hamiltonian of the windmill model\nreads\nwhere _⟨i, j⟩_ denotes summation over each nearestneighbor pair, the index _{t, A, B}_ refers to the sublattices and _Jt, Jh, Jth_ are positive, _i.e._, antiferromagnetic, coupling constants. In the classical windmill model\nall spins are classical unit vectors. The vectors have\nthree components in the case of Heisenberg spins _**S**_ _i_ _[α]_ [=]\n( _Si,x_ _[α]_ _[, S]_ _i,y_ _[α]_ _[, S]_ _i,z_ _[α]_ [) and two components in the case of planar]\n(XY) spins _**S**_ _i_ _[α]_ [= (] _[S]_ _i,x_ _[α]_ _[, S]_ _i,y_ _[α]_ [) with] _[ α][ ∈{][t, A, B][}]_ [.]\nThe triangular Bravais lattice with lattice constant _a_\nis spanned by the _√_ primitive lattice vectors _**a**_ 1 = _a_ (1 _,_ 0)\nand _**a**_ 2 = _a_ 2 [(1] _[,]_ 3).

We then extract variational forms of the spin\nconfigurations and determine the variational parameters\nby minimizing the corresponding ground state energies.\nWe analytically find the configuration of minimal energy which determines the phase diagram and the phase\nboundaries.\nWe begin with an explanation of the iterative minimization algorithm. Starting from a randomized spin\nconfiguration, in every iteration of the algorithm a spin\nis chosen at random and rotated such as to minimize the\ninteraction energy with its neighbors. Each step of the\nalgorithm is an update of the form\n_Jt_  - _k_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[t]_ [+] _[ J][th]_  - _k,ν_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[ν]_\n_∥Jt_ ~~�~~ _k_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[t]_ [+] _[ J][th]_ ~~�~~ _k,ν_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[ν]_\n_Jh_ - _k,ν_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[ν]_ [+] _[ J][th]_ - _k_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[t]_\n_∥Jh_ ~~�~~ _**[S]**_ _[ν]_ [+] _[ J][th]_ ~~�~~ _**[S]**_ _[t]_\n  _k_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[t]_ [+] _[ J][th]_\n~~�~~\n_k_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[t]_ [+] _[ J][th]_\n_Jt_        _**S**_ _i_ _[t]_ _[→]_ _**[S]**_ _i_ _[t]_ [=] _[ −]_ ~~�~~\n(2)\n_k,ν_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[ν][∥]_\n   _k,ν_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[ν]_ [+] _[ J][th]_\n~~�~~\n_k,ν_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[ν]_ [+] _[ J][th]_\n_Jh_        _**S**_ _j_ _[α]_ _[→]_ _**[S]**_ _j_ _[α]_ [=] _[ −]_ ~~�~~\n(3)\n_k_ _**[S]**_ _k_ _[t]_ _[∥]_\n_H_ = _Jt_ \n- _**S**_ _i_ _[t]_ _[·]_ _**[ S]**_ _j_ _[t]_ [+] _[ J][h]_ \n_⟨ij⟩_ _⟨ij⟩_\n- _**S**_ _i_ _[A]_ _[·]_ _**[ S]**_ _j_ _[B]_\n_⟨ij⟩_\n+ _Jth_ - _**S**_ _i_ _[t]_ _[·]_ _**[ S]**_ _j_ _[ν]_ (1)\n_⟨ij⟩,ν_ = _A,B_\nwith the index _α ∈{A, B}_ . The sum over index _ν_ = _A, B_\nruns over both honeycomb sublattices and the summation over the index _k_ ranges over the neighbors of the\nspin that is being updated. This technique does not provide rigorous proofs for the correctness of the discovered\nphases. One difficulty that one may imagine is that the\nalgorithm converges to a local minimum of the energy\nlandscape. In this case a local update is not capable of\nimproving the energy. This possibility is made unlikely\nby the fact that for all phases we ran the algorithm multiple times with different random initial configurations\nand observed that the system always converged to the\nsame phase.\nIn order to discover the groundstate configurations,\nthe algorithm was applied to a spin system with\n_N_ = _L × L_ = 30 _×_ 30 unit cells ( _i.e._, _N_ triangular spins\nand 2 _N_ honeycomb spins) with periodic boundary conditions. We applied the minimization algorithm for 50,000\nsteps. The resulting spin configurations were all explored\nand a mathematical description of their spin ordering was\nextracted, from which the energies were analytically calculated.\nAfter the numerical search, we performed systematic\nruns on a lattice with _N_ = 12 _×_ 12 unit cells to confirm the\nabsence of further phases. This run was performed for the\nregime of parameters _Jh/Jt ∈_ [0 _._ 2 _, . . .,_ 9 _._ 4] in steps of 0 _._ 1\nand _Jth/Jt ∈_ [0 _._ 2 _, . . .,_ 9 _._ 4] in steps of 0 _._ 1. At every point\nwithin this parameter range, the minimization algorithm\nwas applied for 60 _,_ 000 _× N_ iterations. Every application\noptimized one randomly chosen triangular lattice spin\nand one randomly chosen honeycomb lattice spin. The\nresulting energies of the converged configurations were\ncompared to the analytically computed energies.\nSome of the discovered phases have spin configurations that depend parametrically on the coupling constants such as the pitch angle in a spiral phase. Here,\nwe computed the energy by leaving these variables, like\nthe pitch angle, as variational parameters and obtained\ntheir value by minimizing the energy with respect to the\nwere highly converged such that the energy per spin that\nemerged from the simulation numerically coincided exactly with the energy computed by minimization of the\nvariational state. Similarly, the spin configurations (e.g.\nscalar products between neighboring spins) of all the simulated phases were to many digits identical to those of\nthe phases proposed. In the few cases where the convergence was not so good, which was evidenced by the\nhigher energy per spin value, we investigated snapshots of\nthe spin configurations and found that the algorithm had\nbeen trapped in a local minimum with topological defects\nthat could not be removed by local updates. Neverthless,\neven in the presence of these defects the snapshots still\nshowed ordering of the spins that were clearly those of\nthe proposed phases.\nAs a final test we repeated the systematic run with\nMonte Carlo simulations. The simulations were carried\nout at 40 temperature points _Ti_ covering the interval\n[10 _[−]_ [3] _Jt, . . .,_ 2 _._ 0 _Jt_ ]. The temperature points are chosen\nto be geometrically spaced [31], _i.e._, _Ti_ +1 _/Ti_ is a constant\nratio. The lattice has _N_ = _L × L_ = 30 _×_ 30 unit cells\nand we again employ periodic boundary conditions. The\nsimulations are done in parallel for all temperatures with\nthe spin configurations of the 40 lattices stored simultaneously. To every one of these lattices the heat-bath\nalgorithm is applied _N_ times. This is followed by a parallel tempering move. The latter kind of update consists in proposing for every pair of neighboring temperatures ( _Ti, Ti_ +1) an exchange of the full spin configurations. The proposals are accepted/rejected according to\nthe standard Metropolis-Hastings rule. The parallel tempering algorithm helps to quickly produce uncorrelated\nspin configurations.\n3\nThe cycle of heat-bath steps followed by parallel tempering updates was repeated a total of 10 _,_ 000 times before we finally measured the energy of the lattice with\nthe smallest temperature.\nIn this way the energies were determined for the coupling constants in the parameter regime _jh ≡_ _Jh/Jt ∈_\n[0 _._ 1 _, . . .,_ 10 _._ 0] and _J_ [¯] _≡_ _Jth/_ _[√]_ _JtJh ∈_ [0 _._ 1 _, . . .,_ 4 _._ 0]. We\nfound all resulting energies to be slightly larger than the\nanalytically calculated minimum energies. This is further\nconfirmation of the absence of ground state phases other\nthan the ones we have found.\n**IV.** **GROUND STATE PHASE DIAGRAM OF**\n**HEISENBERG WINDMILL MODEL**\nThe complete ground state phase diagram of the\nHeisenberg windmill model is shown in Fig. 2 as a\nfunction of the ratios of coupling constants _Jt/Jh_ and\n_Jth/_ _[√]_ _JtJh_ . Note that the vertical axis is the ratio _Jt/Jh_\nin the upper panel of the figure, while we use the inverse ratio _Jh/Jt_ in the lower panel. The horizontal axis\nis _Jth/_ _[√]_ _JtJh_ . In total, the Heisenberg model exhibits\neight different ground state phases, which we describe in\ndetail in Sec. V.\nThe energies of the different spin configurations, measured in units of _Jt_, are functions of the dimensionless\ncoupling constant ratios\n_jh_ = _Jh/Jt_ (4)\n_jth_ = _Jth/Jt._ (5)\nThe ground state energy _E_ ( _jh, jth_ ) is defined as the energy of the spin configuration with the lowest energy, and\nthe ground state phase is described by this spin configuration.\nAs a function of the couplings _jh_ and _jth_ there will\neventually be level crossings where the energies of the\nspin configurations with the lowest two energies switch\nplaces [32] . A phase transition occurs at a crossing of the\nenergies of two different spin configurations. Exactly\nat the transition point, their energies match, but their\n(higher order) derivatives will generally not be the same.\nAccording to the usual Ehrenfest classification of phase\ntransitions, the order of the phase transition is determined by the lowest order of the derivative of the ground\nstate energy _E_ ( _jh, jth_ ) with respect to the tuning parameter, _jh_ or _jth_, that exhibits a singularity. In the phase\ndiagram we have indicated the order of the phase transition by the labels 1 [st] and 2 [nd] for first and second order\nphase transitions.\nSome of the discovered phases are continuously connected to each other, and exactly at the level crossing the\nspin configurations are identical. We often denote those\nphases in the phase diagram by the suffix a or b. In this\ncase both the energies as well as the first order derivatives of the energies will match at the transition point.\nThe second order derivatives, however, will in general not\nbe equal. The phase transitions between phases that are\nFIG. 2. Ground state phase diagram of the Heisenberg model\non the windmill lattice as a function of the dimensionless ratios of coupling constants _Jt/Jh_ and _Jth/_ ~~_[√]_~~ _JtJh_ . In the upper\nfigure we use the _y_ -axis label _Jt/Jh_ while in the lower figure\nwe use the inverse ratio _Jh/Jt_ . The different phases are described in detail in Sec. V. The order of the phase transition\nbetween the phases is indicated above the arrows. The noncoplanar phases are labelled (4 _a_ ) and (4 _b_ ).\ncontinuously deformed into each other at the transition\nare therefore always of second order.\nThere are two special points in the phase diagram,\nwhere multiple phases become energetically degenerate.\nThese are the points ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _/_ 4 _,_ 1) and at\n( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _,_ 2). One would not expect a large\nnumber of unrelated phases to coincide at one point. In\n4\nphase rule [33] about the number of generically coinciding,\nenergically degenerate phases. Let _E_ 1( _jh, jth_ ) _, E_ 2( _jh, jth_ )\nand _E_ 3( _jh, jth_ ) be the energies of three minimum energy\nphases. The requirement that these energies should coincide at a point ( _jh, jth_ ) is expressed by the conditions\n_E_ 1( _jh, jth_ ) = _E_ 2( _jh, jth_ ) (6)\n_E_ 2( _jh, jth_ ) = _E_ 3( _jh, jth_ ) (7)\nwhich can be expected to be a solvable system in _jh_ and\n_jth_, since the number of variables equals the number of\nconditions. Equating a larger number of energy functions\nin a special way. Thus the number of generically coincident points is limited to three.\nIn the ground state phase diagram in Fig. 2 there\nare, however, seven phases coinciding at the point\n( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _,_ 2) and four phases coinciding at the\npoint ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _/_ 4 _,_ 1). This is possible because a\nnumber of these phases are related to each other in the\nway described above, _i.e._, they continuously transform\ninto each other at the degeneracy point.\nLet us consider the point ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _,_ 2) in\nmore detail. The detailed description of the different\nphases can be found below in Sec. V. Exactly at the\npoint ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _,_ 2) there are two energetically\nequal ground state configurations, which are those of\nphase (2 _b_ ) and phase (3 _b_ ) (see Secs. V B and V C). In\nthe limit ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) _→_ (1 _,_ 2) the spin configurations\nof all the surrounding phases are equal to the configuration of one of these two phases. All these phases must,\ntherefore, meet at this point in the phase diagram. Obviously phase (2 _a_ ) deforms into (2 _b_ ) and phase (3 _a_ ) into\n(3 _b_ ). The half-opening angles of the conical phase (4 _a_ )\n(see Sec. V D) go to zero in this limit, which yields a spin\nconfiguration identical to the one of phase (2 _b_ ). Similarly, the spiral angle of phase (5) (see Sec. V E) goes to\nzero resulting in a spin configuration that is identical to\nthe one of phase (3 _b_ ).\nA similar line of reasoning explains the degeneracy at\nthe point ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _/_ 4 _,_ 1). Here, phases (4 _b_ ) and\n(2 _a_ ) turn into (2 _b_ ). The opening angle _αt_ of the double\ncone configuration tends to zero as the border to region\n(2b) is approached. This border includes the degeneracy\npoint, as shown in the phase diagram.\n**V.** **GROUND STATE PHASES**\nIn the following we describe the phases that were found\nin a broad search of the two-dimensional parameter space\n( _jh_ = _Jh/Jt, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ = _Jth/_ _[√]_ _JtJh_ ). The phases are labelled as shown in the phase diagram in Fig. 2. In describing these phases we adopt the convention of placing\nthe spins in the coplanar phases in the _Sx_ - _Sy_ -plane in\nspin space. In many of the following phases there is an\nadditional degeneracy in that a certain symmetry may\nbe broken along different directions of lattice space. In\nwindmill model the only major modification in the phase\ndiagram, apart from a quantitative shift of the phase\nboundaries, takes place in the regions where the Heisenberg model exhibits non-coplanar phases. These regions\nare now largely occupied by two new planar phases, (XY\nI) and (XY II), which we describe below.\nOf the two highly degenerate points in the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model, only one remains in the\nplanar model: at the point ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) = (1 _,_ 2) six\nphases meet. Like in the case of the Heisenberg model,\nthis high degeneracy is explained by the fact that all six\nphases deform into either phase (2 _b_ ) or phase (3 _b_ ) in the\nlimit ( _jh, jth/_ _[√]_ _jh_ ) _→_ (1 _,_ 2). Thus there are only two distinct phases present at this point. In particular, phase\n(XY II) transforms into phase (2 _b_ ), as we explain below.\n**A.** **Incommensurate alternating spiral phase (XY I)**\nIn place of the non-coplanar phase (4 _b_ ) we now find a\nnew planar phase. We denote this phase by (XY I). It\nis an incommensurate spiral phase with the directions of\nspins alternating from one site to the next. It is shown\nin Fig. 12. It may be described as a twisted N´eel-ordered\nconfiguration. The spin configuration is given by\n_**S**_ _[t]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n_**S**_ _[A]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n_**S**_ _[B]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\ncos( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ )\nsin( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ )\ncos ( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ + 2 _θ_ )\nsin ( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ + 2 _θ_ )\n11\nFIG. 12. Phase (XY I). Left: _**Q**_ vectors are identical for\nall sublattices. By specifying _θ_ the wave vectors come to lie\neither on the boundary or on the dashed lines.

Four further\nsymmetry related phases are possible with _**Q**_ vectors\n_**Q**_ = _±_ [1] (51)\n2 _π_ [(2] _[θ, θ]_ [ +] _[ π]_ [)]\nand\n_**Q**_ = _±_ [1] (52)\n2 _π_ [(] _[θ]_ [ +] _[ π, π][ −]_ _[θ]_ [)] _[.]_\nImposing the condition that the angle _θ_ be real, yields\n_jh_ + 2 _jth ≤_ 1 _._ (53)\nThis phase is never an energy minimum for the Heisenberg model, since the non-coplanar phase (4b) includes\nthe whole range of existence of phase (XY I) and has a\nsmaller energy.\nLike in the case of the incommensurate spiral phase\n(5), the order parameter of phase (XY I) is determined by\ngiving the direction of two triangular lattice spins and by\nspecifying one of the three _**Q**_ vectors. Hence, its manifold\nis _O_ (2) _×_ Z3.\n**B.** **Canted ferromagnetic phase (XY II)**\nThe phase (XY II) is found in the former region of\nthe non-coplanar phase (4 _a_ ) in the phase diagram. It is\ndepicted on the left of Fig. 13. All spins lie symmetrically\nabout a line, which we choose in the following to be the\n_x_ -axis.\nThe spin configuration is related to the double-cone\nstate, since it can be obtained by forcing the double-cone\ncos ( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ + _θ_ )\nsin ( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ + _θ_ )\n(46)\n(47)\n(48)\nFIG. 13.

  "conclusion": "about the symmetry properties. Next to the figures with\nthe spin arrangements are shown the positions of the ordering wave vectors in the Brillouin zone with the wave\nvectors of the honeycomb lattice as blue points and triangular lattice as red points.\nIn some of the following ground state phases the symmetry of the lattice is broken. This can manifest itself, for\nexample, in stripes of equal spin orientation along a certain direction in lattice space. In such cases, one can obtain a distinct, but energetically degenerate ground state\nby means of a rotation of all spins in lattice space around\nan arbitrary triangular site. The description of such a rotated state is complicated by the fact that the windmill\nlattice has a three site basis. The operation of rotating\nthe lattice by 60 _[◦]_ will in general also involve a reattribution of honeycomb spins to their respective unit cells and\na possible relabeling of A into B site spins and vice versa.\nIn order to avoid such complications, our description in\nthe following will always be of only one lattice configuration. The other symmetry related configurations are\ndiscussed.\nThe differerent phases are characterized by their order parameter manifold. This manifold is defined as the\nsymmetry group, whose elements transform a given spin\nconfiguration into a distinct, but energetically degenerate\nconfiguration. A simple (anti-)ferromagnetic state in the\nHeisenberg model thus has the order parameter manifold\n_O_ (3) _/O_ (2), since it is characterized by a normalized unit\nvector in the direction of magnetization _**n**_ . Global rotations around an axis that is not (anti-)parallel to a given\nmagnetization _**n**_ yield another energetically degenerate\nground state spin configuration. In Table IV we list the\norder parameters manifolds of the various ground state\nphases.\nWe measure energies in units of _NJt_, where _N_ is the\nnumber of the spins on the triangular lattice. The energies of the ground state spin configurations can be analytically calculated and are given in Table II. We refer\nto Appendix A for the details.

Parametric location of the phase boundaries and\norder of the phase transition between different phases in the\nground state phase diagram of the Heisenberg and XY windmill model (see Figs. 2 and 11).\nFIG. 3. Decoupled windmill phase (1). In this phase the\ntwo sublattices are decoupled. The triangular lattice spins\nhave a 120 _[◦]_ order, whereas the honeycomb spins are N´eel\nordered. Left: Ordering wave vectors for honeycomb (yellow)\nand triangular (red) lattice\nshown in Fig. 3, and an analytical expression is given by\n\n\n_**S**_ _[t]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n_**S**_ _[A]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n\ncos( _**Q**_ _[t]_ _·_ _**r**_ )\nsin( _**Q**_ _[t]_ _·_ _**r**_ )\n\n0\n\ncos( _**Q**_ _[A]_ _·_ _**r**_ )\nsin( _**Q**_ _[A]_ _·_ _**r**_ )\n\n0\n (9)\n\n (8)\n\n\n\n6\nvector _**t**_ 3 is essential to encapsulate the chirality of the\nordering, _i.e._, _XY Z_ ordering versus _XZY_ . The chirality\non a triangular plaquette is defined to be negative (positive), if the rotation of spins going from site _X_ to _Y_ to _Z_\nis (counter)clockwise. If the plane of triangular spin order is given by the _x_ - _y_ -plane of real-space, as is assumed\nin Fig. 3, a positive (negative) chirality corresponds to\nthe unit vector _**t**_ 3 pointing out-of (into) the plane. The\nchirality of the configuration can be changed by performing a _π_ -rotation around an axis that lies in the plane of\nthe triangular spins. The order parameter manifold of\nthe triangular lattice spins is thus given by _SO_ (3).\nThe order parameter of the honeycomb lattice spins\ncan be defined by a unit vector _**n**_ that points along the\ndirection of the _A_ -site spins, and global rotations around\nan axis that is not parallel (or anti-parallel) to _**n**_ yield\nother energetically degenerate spin configurations. The\norder parameter manifold of the “decoupled windmill”\nphase (1) is thus given by _SO_ (3) _× O_ (3) _/O_ (2).\nWe finally mention that at finite temperatures, it was\nshown in Refs. 20 and 21 that thermal (or quantum) fluctuations around this ground state lead to a finite temperature phase diagram with Z6 order and an emergent\ncritical phase.\n**B.** **Collinear antiferromagnetic phase/canted**\n**ferromagnetic phase (** 2 _a_ **) and (** 2 _b_ **)**\nThis is a planar phase in which the spins on the triangular sublattice are collinearly ordered, _i.e._, ferromagnetically along one lattice direction and antiferromagnetically along the others. The _A_ / _B_ honeycomb sublattices\nare each collinear canted ferromagnets with spins on the\n_B_ sites that are antiparallel to two of the neighboring\nspins on the _A_ -site. The spin configuration is shown in\nFig. 4. We have chosen the direction of one of the triangular lattice spins to be along the _Sx_ -axis of spin space.\nAn analytical expression of the spin configuration in this\nphase is given by\n_**S**_ _[B]_ ( _**r**_ ) = _−_ _**S**_ _[A]_ ( _**r**_ ) _._ (10)\nHere, _**r**_ = _n_ _**a**_ 1 + _m_ _**a**_ 2 is a Bravais lattice vector and the\nordering wave vectors read in the basis of the reciprocal\nlattice vectors as\n_**Q**_ _[t]_ = _±_ (1 _/_ 3 _, −_ 1 _/_ 3) (11)\n_**Q**_ _[A,B]_ = (0 _,_ 0) _._ (12)\nThe triangular ordering vectors are thus given by _**Q**_ _[t]_ =\n_±_ ( _**G**_ 1 _/_ 3 _−_ _**G**_ 2 _/_ 3) = _±_ 2 _π_ ( [1] 3 _[,][ −]_ ~~_√_~~ [1] 3 [) and are located, as]\nshown in Fig. 3, at the corners of the first Brillouin zone.\nOnly two of those six corners are non-equivalent, _i.e._,\ncannot be reached by adding a reciprocal lattice vector.\nWe have chosen to place the honeycomb spins in the same\nplane as the triangular lattice spins. This is only done\nfor convenience, since in this configuration the spins on\nthe triangular lattice are decoupled from the spins on the\nhoneycomb lattice: global rotations of spins on either of\nthe two sublattices do not cost any energy. The sign\nof the different wave vectors _**Q**_ _[t]_ corresponds to different\nchiralities of the 120 _[◦]_ -order.\nTo find the order parameter manifold of this phase,\nwe first divide the tripartite triangular lattice into _X, Y_\nand _Z_ -sites, where the different sites correspond to the\nthree possible directions of triangular lattice spins in the\n120 _[◦]_ configuration. Consider a plaquette of _X_ -, _Y_ - and\n_Z_ -site spins and let _**t**_ 2 be a unit vector along the spin\non the _X_ -sites _**S**_ _X_ . Then define the unit vector _**t**_ 1 to be\nparallel to the component of the spin _**S**_ _Y_ on the _Y_ sites\nthat is orthogonal to _**S**_ _X_ . Finally, define the unit vector\n_**t**_ 3 = _**t**_ 1 _×_ _**t**_ 2. The triad ( _**t**_ 1 _,_ _**t**_ 2 _,_ _**t**_ 3) that is defined in this\nway is the local order parameter for the 120 _[◦]_ phase.

Collinear Antiferromagnet/Canted Ferromagnet (left:\n(2 _a_ ), right: (2 _b_ )). Phase (2a) can exist only for _jth <_ 2 _jh_,\nwhen this inequality is violated, phase (2b) minimizes the\nenergy. In configuration (2a) the honeycomb spins can be\nglobally rotated around the triangular spin direction without\nany cost in energy. The ordering wave vectors of both lattices\nare identical.\n_**Q**_ _[t]_ = _**Q**_ _[A,B]_ _∈{_ (1 _/_ 2 _,_ 0) _,_ (0 _,_ 1 _/_ 2) _,_ (1 _/_ 2 _,_ 1 _/_ 2) _} ._ (18)\nThe form of _θ_ was obtained by taking it as a variational parameter and minimizing the energy found from\nthe explicit evaluation of the Hamiltonian (we refer to\nAppendix A 1 for details).\nNote that _θ_ is undefined for _jth >_ 2 _jh_ . In this latter range the minimum is instead found at _θ_ = 0. The\nregion where this phase is hosted is denoted (2 _b_ ) in the\nphase diagram. The transition between this configuration and one of finite _θ_ is accompanied by a discontinuity\nof the second derivative of the energy as a function of the\ncoupling constants, _i.e._, the phase transition between the\nphases (2 _a_ ) and (2 _b_ ) is of second order.\nThe order parameter is given by defining the direction of one triangular lattice spin and by specifying\none direction in lattice space in which the spins are\ncollinear with the chosen spin. For the latter there are\nthree possible choices. The honeycomb spins arrange\nthemselves in a plane that contains the triangular spins\nand enclose a certain angle _θ_ with the triangular spins.\nGlobal _O_ (2) rotations of the honeycomb spins around\nan axis parallel to the triangular spins yield energetically degenerate spin configurations. The order parameter manifold of the phases (2 _a_ ) and (2 _b_ ) is thus given by\n_O_ (3) _/O_ (2) _× O_ (2) _×_ Z3.\n**C.** **Ferromagnetic phases (** 3 _a_ **) and (** 3 _b_ **)**\nIn phase (3 _a_ ) all three sublattices are separately ferromagnetically ordered. The spins on the honeycomb _A_\nand _B_ sites enclose an angle _θ_ with the triangular spins,\nbut point in mirror opposite directions with respect to\nthe triangular spins. The spin configuration is depicted\n7\nFIG. 5. Left: (3a), right: (3b). All three sublattices are\nferromagnetically ordered. In phase (3a) the relative angles\nbetween the lattices is tunable by changing _jth_ . However,\nonce _jth ≥_ 2 _jh_ the spins become locked in the configuration\n(3b).\nFIG. 6. Figure shows the _dice lattice_ obtained in the limit\nof large _Jth ≫_ _Jt, Jh_ . This is effectively the lattice for phase\n(3b). Red (blue) arrows lie on triangular (honeycomb) lattice\nsites.\nin Fig. 5. Let the direction of _**S**_ _[t]_ be the _Sx_ -axis of spin\nspace. An analytical expression of the spin configuration\nreads\nThe ordering wave vectors are all identically zero, which\ncorresponds to ferromagnetic order.\nOnce again the variational parameters become undefined for _jth >_ 2 _jh_ . The minimum for this region is instead found at _θ_ = _π_ and the corresponding phase is\ndenoted (3 _b_ ) in the phase diagram. This phase is the\none that would be obtained in the limit of infinite _Jth_\nand finite _Jt, Jh_ . Such a limit corresponds to a lattice\n_**S**_ _[t]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n_**S**_ _[A]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n_**S**_ _[B]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\nwith\n\n1\n 0\n\n0\n\n (19)\n\n\ncos _θ_\n sin _θ_\n\n0\n\n =\n\n\n_−jth/_ (2 _jh_ )\n [1 _−_ _jth_ [2] _[/]_ [(4] _[j]_ _h_ [2][)]][1] _[/]_ [2]\n0\n\n (20)\n\n\ncos _θ_\n _−_ sin _θ_\n\n0\n\n =\n\n\n_−jth/_ (2 _jh_ )\n _−_ [1 _−_ _jth_ [2] _[/]_ [(4] _[j]_ _h_ [2][)]][1] _[/]_ [2]\n0\n\n(21)\n\ncos( _θ_ ) = _−_ _[j][th]_ _._ (22)\n2 _jh_\nwhere there is a vanishingly small coupling within the\ntriangular lattice and within the honeycomb lattice, but\na dominant inter-sublattice coupling _Jth_ . The resulting\nbipartite lattice is depicted in Fig. 6 and is known as the\n_dice lattice_ . It is the dual of the kagome lattice and has\nbeen studied in the literature in various contexts [34] .\nThe order parameter manifold of this phase is defined\nby the direction of the triangular lattice spin. The energy\nof phase (3 _a_ ) remains invariant, however, if we rotate all\nhoneycomb spins around an axis parallel to the triangular\nspin, which corresponds to an _O_ (2) symmetry. Therefore,\nthe order parameter manifold of phase (3 _a_ ) is given by\n_O_ (3) _/O_ (2) _× O_ (2), whereas that of phase (3 _b_ ) is equal to\n_O_ (3) _/O_ (2).\n**D.** **Double cone phases (** 4 _a_ **) and (** 4 _b_ **)**\nSpins in the phases (4 _a_ ) and (4 _b_ ) exhibit a noncoplanar arrangement. In phase (4 _a_ ), spins on the triangular and the honeycomb lattice lie on separate doublecones. The phase (4 _a_ ) is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The\ndouble cone structure is depicted in Fig. 7 and the arrangement of the spins on the lattice is clearly illustrated\nin Fig. 8. As one moves horizontally in lattice space along\n_**a**_ 1 ( _**a**_ 2) from one site to the next, the spins advance by\nan azimuth angle of _θ_ (2 _θ_ ). In other words, the spins\nin the figure labelled by the same angles share a common plane in spin space. Additionally, they alternately\nlie on upper and lower cones, which is represented by\nblue and red in Fig. 8. We are showing only one of the\nsix symmetry-related ground states. The others are obtained by rotating the lattice through an angle of (2 _π/_ 6) _n_\nwith _n_ = 1 _, . . .,_ 5.\nNon-coplanar ground states, similar to the ones we\nhave found, have also been discovered in Heisenberg models on triangular, square, pyrochlore and octahedral lattices [26][,][27][,][35][,][36] . The interest in such phases stems from\nthe fact that non-coplanar spin orderings are expected to\ngive rise to an anomalous Hall effect [37], due to the nonvanishing spin chirality. Moreover, considering quantum\nfluctuations it is expected that non-coplanar classical\nground states give rise to chiral spin liquid phases [26][,][38][,][39] .\nTo describe this configuration we choose the opening\naxis of the cones to be the _Sz_ -axis. Then the spins are\ndescribed by\n\n\n_**S**_ _[t]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\n_**S**_ _[A]_ ( _**r**_ ) =\nsin( _αt_ ) cos( _**Q**_ 1 _·_ _**r**_ )\n sin( _αt_ ) sin( _**Q**_ 1 _·_ _**r**_ )\ncos( _αt_ ) cos( _**Q**_ 2 _·_ _**r**_ )\n_−_ sin( _αh_ ) cos( _**Q**_ 1 _·_ _**r**_ + _θ_ )\n _−_ sin( _αh_ ) sin( _**Q**_ 1 _·_ _**r**_ + _θ_ )\n_−_ cos( _αh_ ) cos( _**Q**_ 2 _·_ _**r**_ )\n (24)\n\n (23)\n\n\n\n8\nFIG. 7. Double Cone Phase (4 _a_ ). Spins on the triangular\n(top) and the honeycomb lattice (bottom) lie on separate\ndouble cones with different opening angles _αt_ and _αh_ . In\nthe figures we use the notation _**S**_ _n_ _[t,A,B]_ +1 = _**S**_ 1 _[t,A,B]_ ( _**r**_ + _n_ _**a**_ 1) and\n_**S**_ 2 _[t,A,B]_ _n_ +1 [=] _**[ S]**_ 1 _[t,A,B]_ ( _**r**_ + _n_ _**a**_ 2).\nFIG. 8. Double Cone Phase (4 _a_ ). Left: _**Q**_ vectors of all\nsublattices are identical. The phase contains one of the three\n_**Q**_ vectors on the boundary and one from the dashed lines.\nSpecifying _θ_ determines the exact position of the _**Q**_ vector\non the dashed lines. Right: Scheme of spin orientations on\nthe lattice. Let the middle reference spin be on the upper\ndouble cone of the triangular lattice. The blue (red) spins lie\non upper (lower) cones. The angles describe by how much a\nspin’s azimuthal angle differs from that of the reference spin.\nwith ordering wave vectors\n_**Q**_ 1 = _±_ [1] (26)\n2 _π_ [(] _[θ,]_ [ 2] _[θ]_ [)]\n_**Q**_ 2 = (1 _/_ 2 _,_ 0) (27)\n_**S**_ _[B]_ ( _**r**_ ) = _**S**_ _[A]_ ( _**r**_ + _**a**_ 1) (25)\nThe ambiguity in sign corresponds to two possible orderings that are related by a _π_ -rotation in lattice space.\nFour other orderings are possible, that correspond to the\nremaining rotated states\n_**Q**_ 1 = _±_ [1] (28)\n2 _π_ [(] _[θ,][ −][θ]_ [)]\n_**Q**_ 2 = (1 _/_ 2 _,_ 1 _/_ 2) (29)\nand\n_**Q**_ 1 = _±_ [1] (30)\n2 _π_ [(2] _[θ, θ]_ [)]\n_**Q**_ 2 = (0 _,_ 1 _/_ 2) _._ (31)\nThe angles _αt_ and _αh_ are the half-opening angles of\nthe respective cones. The angle _θ_ is the difference in the\nazimuthal angle, as shown in Fig. 7. These three angles\n_{αt, αh, θ}_ are functions of the coupling constants. By\nsolving the minimization problem (see Appendix A 3) for\nthe set of variables _{αt, αh, θ}_, one finds the solution\n1 _−_ _σ_ [2]\n_ρ_ [2] _−_ _σ_ [2] _[ρ]_ (33)\nsin _αt_ =\nsin _αh_ =\n~~�~~\n~~�~~\n1 _−_ _σ_ [2]\n(32)\n_ρ_ [2] _−_ _σ_ [2]\n_jth_ _−_ ~~�~~\ncos _θ_ = _jth_\n(34)\n2 _[ρ]_\n_jth_ [2] _[−]_ [4] _[j][h]_\n= _[j][th]_\n4 _jh_ 2\nwith\n[sin] _[ α][h]_ = _[j][th]_ _[−]_ ~~�~~\nsin _αt_ 2\n_ρ ≡_ [sin] _[ α][h]_\n_jth_ [2] _[−]_ [4] _[j][h]_\n2 _jh_\n(35)\n9\nFIG. 9. Double Cone Phase (4 _b_ ). The spins on the honeycomb lattice align with the cone axis, while the spins on the\ntriangular lattice lie on a double cone with half-opening angle\ncos _αt_ = 2 _jth_ and advance by a fixed angle of _θ_ = [2] _[πk]_ 3 when\ntranslated by _**a**_ _k_ .\nwe may encode the chirality of the spins via the direction of the cone axis vector. The chirality can thus be\nreversed by a _π_ -rotation around an axis that lies in the\nplane orthogonal to the cone axis. The order in this phase\nis therefore described by an element of _SO_ (3) _×_ Z3.\n**E.** **Incommensurate spiral phase** (5)\nIn phase (5) the spins are arranged in a coplanar incommensurate spiral as shown in Fig. 10. The spin configuration takes the form\n_jth_      - _jth −_      \n[cos] _[ α][h]_ =\ncos _αt_ 8 _j_\n�2\n_jth_ [2] _[−]_ [4] _[j][h]_\n_σ ≡_ [cos] _[ α][h]_\n_._ (36)\n8 _jh_ [2]\n\ncos( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ )\n sin( _**Q**_ _·_ _**r**_ )\n\n0\n\n (38)\n\nGenerally both angles _αt, αh_ are nonzero.\nAnother solution to the minimization problem exists,\nfor which _ρ_ = 0. The corresponding phase is denoted\nby (4 _b_ ) and is shown in Fig. 9. In this configuration the\nhoneycomb lattice spins are aligned with the cone axis,\nwhile the triangular lattice spins lie again on a cone with\nvariable half-opening angle\ncos _αt_ = 2 _jth ._ (37)\nConsecutive triangular lattice spins rotate by an angle of\n_θ_ = 2 _π/_ 3 around the cone axis.\nThe order of both phases may be described by first\nspecifying the cone axis and one of the triangular lattice spins. Once this choice is made, there is a further\ndegeneracy due to the freedom in rotating the lattice,\nas explained above. Thus there are six energetically degenerate configurations. These six possibilities may be\nfurther classified into two chiralities: three cover the configurations that describe a right handed screw around the\ncone axis when advancing in the _**a**_ 1 direction and three\ndescribe a left handed screw. In specifying the cone axis,\nwhere the ordering wave vector is given by\n_**Q**_ = _±_ [1] (41)\n2 _π_ [(] _[θ,]_ [ 2] _[θ]_ [)] _[.]_\nwith the angle _θ_ defined via\ncos _θ_ = _−_ [1] 2 [(1 +] _[ j][h][ −]_ [2] _[j][th]_ [)] _[ .]_ (42)\nAs for the double cone phase, the sign ambiguity of _**Q**_\ndescribes the chirality.

Phase (5). Left: _**Q**_ vector is identical for all sublattices. It lies on one of the dashed lines and is determined\nby _θ_ . Right: The spins exhibit incommensurate spiral order.\nThe spiral can be either left-handed or right-handed.\nconfigurations exist and are described by the _**Q**_ vectors\n_**Q**_ = _±_ [1] (43)\n2 _π_ [(2] _[θ, θ]_ [)]\nand\n_**Q**_ = _±_ [1] (44)\n2 _π_ [(] _[θ,][ −][θ]_ [)] _[.]_\nThe right-hand side of Eq. (42) must satisfy\n_|_ (1 + _jh −_ 2 _jth_ ) _| ≤_ 2 _._ (45)\nFor parameters that violate this inequality the minimum\nis instead found at either _θ_ = 0 or _θ_ = _π_ . The former\ncase is identical to phase (3 _b_ ) and the latter one to phase\n(2 _b_ ).\nIn the spiral phase the triangular lattice spins have\nthe same order parameter manifold as the 120 _[◦]_ ordered\nspins of phase (1). This is clear, since the 120 _[◦]_ order is\njust a special case of this incommensurate spiral phase.\nAn incommensurate spiral phase on the windmill lattice,\nhowever, can appear in three distinct types, as described\nabove, three of each chirality. The order parameter manifold of the incommensurate spiral phase is thus equal to\n_SO_ (3) _×_ Z3.\n**VI.** **PLANAR (XY) WINDMILL MODEL**\nWe now discuss the XY windmill model, where planar\n(XY) spins _**S**_ _i_ _[α]_ [= (] _[S]_ _i,x_ _[α]_ _[, S]_ _i,y_ _[α]_ [),] _[ α][ ∈{][t, A, B][}]_ [, are placed]\n|Phase|Order Parameter Manifold (planar model)|\n|---|---|\n|1<br>2a, 2b<br>3a<br>3b<br>5<br>XY I<br>XY II|_O_(2)_ × SO_(2)<br>_SO_(2)_ ×_ Z6<br>_SO_(2)_ ×_ Z2<br>_SO_(2)<br>_O_(2)_ ×_ Z3<br>_O_(2)_ ×_ Z3<br>_O_(2)_ ×_ Z3|\nTABLE IV. Order parameter manifolds in the planar windmill\nmodel.\n10\nFIG. 11. Ground state phase diagram of the XY windmill\nmodel. The top figure has as the vertical axis _Jt/Jh_, while in\nthe lower panel it is _Jh/Jt_ . The 6 planar phases of the Heisenberg windmill model reappear, with two additional phases\nlabelled (XY I) and (XY II)\non the vertices of the windmill lattice (see Fig. 1). This\ncase is particularly interesting given the recent advances\nin the field of ultracold atoms, where XY spins with\nnearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions were successfully simulated on a triangular lattice [22][,][23] . The lattice is created by means of standing wave laser fields.\nThe atoms are trapped in and tunnel between the local minima of this optical lattice. At low temperatures,\nthe system becomes superfluid and the atoms have well\ndefined local condensate phases _φi_ at every site _i_ of the\nlattice. This U(1) degree of freedom plays the role of the\nXY spins _**S**_ _i_ = (cos _φi,_ sin _φi_ ). The nearest-neighbor spin\ncouplings are determined by the tunneling amplitudes of\natoms that move between the different laser field minima. For normal quantum mechanical tunneling between\nthe sites, the corresponding spin interaction is always ferromagnetic, favoring a locking of the condensate phases\nto the same value. In contrast, it was recently demonstrated that the tunneling element acquires a non-zero\nPeierls phase by periodically shaking the optical lattice\nand an antiferromagnetic coupling of local XY phases\non a triangular lattice was experimentally realized [22][,][23] .\nAs honeycomb optical lattice geometries have also been\nsuccessfully implemented in various groups [24][,][25][,][40], it is\nentirely feasible to realize the XY windmill model using\ncold bosonic atoms in optical lattices.\nWe have determined the full phase diagram of the XY\nwindmill model. It is shown in Fig. 11. We note that\na coplanar state that minimizes the energy for Heisenberg spins has to minimize the energy for XY spins, as\nWe have determined the complete ground state phase\ndiagram of both the classical Heisenberg and the planar\n(XY) spin models on the windmill lattice. Like the wellknown _J_ 1- _J_ 2-model on the square lattice, the windmill\nmodel couples a lattice to its dual lattice. In the windmill model this is a triangular lattice coupled to its dual\nhoneycomb lattice. Competing antiferromagnetic interactions between the spins lead to a rich ground state\nphenomenology with collinear, coplanar, incommensurate spiral and non-coplanar phases. We discussed different routes to an experimental realization of these spin"
