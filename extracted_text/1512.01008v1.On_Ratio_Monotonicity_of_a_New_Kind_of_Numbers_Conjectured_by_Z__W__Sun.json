  "introduction": "Let {zn}n≥0 be a number-theoretic or combinatorial sequence of positive numbers. A sequence {zn}n≥0 of positive numbers is called (strictly) ratio monotonic if the sequence {zn/zn−1}n≥1 of its consecutive quotients is (strictly) monotonic. The concept of ratio monotonicity is closely related log-convexity and log-concavity. A sequence {zn}[∞] n=0[is called][ log-convex(resp. log-concave)] if for all n ≥ 1[2][2] \n**==> picture [290 x 24] intentionally omitted <==**\nCorrespondingly, if the inequality in (1.1) is strict, we call the sequence {zn}n[∞] =0[is][ strictly log-convex(resp. log-concave)][.] \nClearly, a sequence {zn}[∞] n=0[is (strictly) log-convex(resp.] log-concave) if and only if the sequence {zn+1/zn}n≥0 is (strictly) increasing(resp. decreasing). So, to study the ratio monotonicity is equivalent to study the log-convexity and log-concavity, see [19, 26]. Up to now, the log-convex and log-concave sequences have been extensively investigated as they are often arise in combinatorics, algebra, geometry, analysis, probability and statistics, the reader can refer to [1, 20, 16] for details. \n1 \nRecently, Z. W. Sun [17, 18] posed a series of conjectures about monotonicity of sequences of the following forms {zn+1/zn}[∞] n≥0[,][ {][ n][√] zn}n≥1 and {[n][+1][√] zn+1/[√][n] zn}n≥1. It is worthy to mention that many scholars have made valuable progress on this subject, such as Chen et al. [3], Hou et al. [9], Luca and St˘anic˘a [11], Wang an Zhu [19], Sun and Yang [21] and Zhao [27], etc. \nThe main object of this paper is to prove a conjecture due to Z. W. Sun [17] on ratio monotonicity of a sequence {Rn}[∞] n=0[. This new kind of number] is also introduced by him in [17]. It is defined in the following way: \nn \nn + k \n**==> picture [315 x 41] intentionally omitted <==**\nMoreover, Z. W. Sun also defined the sequence {Sn}n[∞] =0[in [17], where] \n**==> picture [312 x 43] intentionally omitted <==**\nFor the sequence {Sn}[∞] n=0[, Z. W. Sun conjectured that the sequence] {Sn}n[∞] =0[is strictly ratio increasing to the limit 9 and the sequence][ {][√] n Sn}n[∞] =1 is strictly ratio decreasing to the limit 1, which are confirmed by Sun and Yang [21]. \nTheorem 1.1. ([21, Theorem 1.2 ]) The sequence {Sn+1/Sn}n≥3 is strictly increasing to the limit 9, and the sequence {[n][+1][√] Sn+1/[√][n] Sn}n≥1 is strictly decreasing to the limit 1. \nAdditionally, Z. W. Sun put forward a similar conjecture on the sequence {Rn}[∞] n=0[.] \nConjecture 1.2. The sequence {Rn+1/Rn}n≥3 is strictly increasing to the limit 3+2√2, and the sequence {[n][+1][√] Rn+1/[√] n Rn}n≥5 is strictly decreasing to the limit 1. \n**==> picture [95 x 36] intentionally omitted <==**\nBy the inequality in (1.1), the log-convexity or log-concavity of a sequence {zn}n≥0 is equivalent, respectively, to qn ≤ qn+1 or qn ≥ qn+1 for all n ≥ 1. So it suffices to consider whether the sequence {qn}n≥1 decreases or increases, i.e., the ratio monotonicity. To prove {qn}n≥1 increases(resp. decreases), it is enough to find an increasing(resp. a decreasing) sequence {bn}n≥0 such that \n**==> picture [291 x 22] intentionally omitted <==**",

Consider that the recurrence relationship (1.5) implies that for n ≥ 0 \n**==> picture [316 x 30] intentionally omitted <==**\nLet rn =[R] R[n] n[+1][, the recurrence (3.7) is equivalent to] \n**==> picture [325 x 30] intentionally omitted <==**\nFirst seeing that bn < rn < bn+1 holds for 3 ≤ n ≤ 8 by Table 1. So we proceed the proof by induction. Suppose that bn < rn < bn+1 for n ≤ k + 1, i.e., \n· · · < bk < rk < bk+1 < rk+1 < bk+2. \nWe first show that \n**==> picture [381 x 30] intentionally omitted <==**\nNote that rn, bn are all positive numbers for n ≥ 3, and by inductive hypothesis, we have \n**==> picture [408 x 93] intentionally omitted <==**\nThe inequality (3.9) is equivalent to show that \n**==> picture [389 x 116] intentionally omitted <==**\n5 \nLet f (x) = ax[2] +bx+c, where a = −24 �179 + 127√2�, b = 3 �3146 + 2220√2� and c = −3 �1197 + 844√2� . Note that the symmetric axis is x = − 2[b] a[=] 3146+2220√2 16(179+127√2)[≈][1][.][09549, so for][ k][ ≥][3, we have that][ f][(][k][)][ ≤][f][(3) =][ −][3(4647+] 3328√2) < 0, which implies the inequality (3.10). Thus we complete the proof of rn+2 < bn+3 according to the principle of inductive argument. Now we have to prove rk+2 > bk+2. Similarly, according to inductive hypothesis, it suffices to show that \n**==> picture [377 x 111] intentionally omitted <==**\n> 0. \nSo, to prove rk+2 > bk+2 is equivalent to show the (3.11) is valid for k greater than some integer k0. \nConsider that \n**==> picture [316 x 86] intentionally omitted <==**\nIf we let g(x) = a1x[2] +b1x+c1, where a1 = �564 + 396√2� , b1 = − �1557 + 1110√2� and c1 = −654√2 − 915, then the symmetric axis of g(x) is x = − 2[b] a[1] 1[=] −[1557+1110] √2 2(915+654√2)[≈−][0][.][849716][.][ Hence, for][ k][ ≥][4, we have][ g][(][k][)][ ≥][g][(4) =] 9 �209 + 138√2� > 0, which implies that the inequality (3.11), i.e., rk+2 ≥ bk+2. \nAccording the above analysis and inductive argument, for all n ≥ 3, we have bn < rn < bn+1. \nWe are now in a position to consider logarithmic behavior of the sequences {Rn}n[∞] =0[.] \n6 \n## 4 Log-behavior of the sequence {Rn}[∞] n=0 \nn=0 \nBy Lemma 3.1 and the sequence {bn}[∞] n=1[is strictly increasing, we can first] obtain the log-convexity of {Rn}[∞] n=0[.] \nTheorem 4.1. The sequence {Rn}[∞] n=4[is strictly log-convex. Equivalently,] the sequence {Rn+1/Rn}n[∞] =3[is strictly increasing.] \nProof. Consider that R3[2][−][R][2][R][1][= 25][2][ −][7][ ·][ 87 = 16][ >][ 0, and by Lemma] 3.1, we have that for n ≥ 3, \n**==> picture [258 x 30] intentionally omitted <==**\nThis arrives at the sequence {rn}[∞] n=3[is strictly increasing.

The sequence {[√] n Rn}[∞] n=5[is strictly log-concave. Equivalently,] n+1[√] Rn+1 the sequence {[√] n Rn }n[∞] =5[is strictly decreasing.] Proof. We will prove it by Theorem 1.3. To keep notation in Theorem 1.3, we let f (n) = bn−1 = √2 �2 − n−3 1� − 2(n9−1)[+ 3. First, by Lemma 3.1, we] know that Rn 0 < f (n) < < f (n + 1), for n ≥ 5.

This implies that the sequence n+1[√] Rn+1 {[√][n] Rn}[∞] n=9[is strictly log-concave, which is equivalent to][ {][√] n Rn }[∞] n=9[is] strictly decreasing by Proposition 2.1. \nHowever, one can verify that for 5 ≤ n ≤ 8, \nn+1[√] Rn+1 \n**==> picture [44 x 23] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [115 x 22] intentionally omitted <==**\nsince \n> [√] 6 R6 \n**==> picture [325 x 73] intentionally omitted <==**\nThus this completes the proof. \n**==> picture [5 x 8] intentionally omitted <==**\n- [18] Z.
