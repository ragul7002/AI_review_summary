Therefore, developed countries can be grouped as entities with similar rates of growth. \n2. _Given any month in a specific year, its respective annual proportion of e-bike sales is roughly the same as its respective annual proportion of Google searches._ It can be reasonably assumed that during, or before purchasing an e-bike, consumers will Google the term ”electric bikes” and thus, the proportion of annual sales in each month equals the proportion of annual searches in that month. Natural Language Processing has been used in other fields i.e finance [16] \n3. _Nothing unprecedented will cause future e-bike sales to increase or decrease dramatically._ This includes new types of transportation and other outlying factors, such as pandemics or wars. \n4. _E-bike sales will not be hindered by a lack of e-bike production._ Thus, the rate of e-bike production will not significantly impact sales. \n## **0.1 Preparing the Data** \nThe given dataset for e-bike sales lacked consistent historical data. In order to maximize the amount of information we could leverage in our models, we successively applied the following transformations. The code for this procedure is available in _Appendix 5.1_ . \n1. _Merging European data._ Global Assumption 1 allows us to determine U.S. e-bike sales from 2006 to 2017 using data on European e-bike sales by utilizing a LaGrange interpolation with a first-degree polynomial. For every year from 2006 to 2017 of which we were not provided data on U.S. e-bike sales, we calculated the proportion of European sales that year to European sales in 2019, and used this proportion to find the number of e-bikes sold in the U.S. that year (in relation to U.S. sales in 2019) [19], [11], [8]. \n2. _Computing Monthly Sales._ Global Assumption 2 allows us to use monthly Google search proportions for the term ”electric bikes” [5] in combination with the annual e-bike sale data from above to develop monthly sale data. For a given year, we found the monthly distribution of search frequencies as a proportion relative to the total annual frequency. Then, we found each month’s e-bike sales by multiplying its respective search proportion by that year’s total annual sales. \n5 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \n## **1 Part I: The Road Ahead** \n## **1.1 Defining the Problem** \nIn this problem, we were asked to create a model to predict annual e-bike sales in the United States. Using it, we were asked to predict American sales for e-bikes sales two (2025) and five (2028) years from now. \n## **1.2 Local Assumptions** \n1. _There exist adequate charging stations in the US transportation system_ [7]. Given that electric bikes are able to be charged by a standard wall outlet, it can be concluded availability of charging stations does not affect sales. \n2. _The cost of e-bike constituent materials will stay within reasonable bounds._ E- bicycles have a high percent composition of aluminum alloy. The increase in the cost of aluminum alloy is projected to be directly proportional to U.S inflation rates and thus would not pose a significant impact on e-bike production [4]. \n3. _The majority of e-bike owners are adults._ Given that over 40 states in the United States have an age limit or require a license to operate an electric bike[2], it can be concluded that the vast majority of e-bike owners and buyers will be adults. Therefore, potential buyers will not be affected by an inability to operate the vehicle [10]. \n4. _Roads and transportation systems will accommodate e-bikes._ The majority of states allow e-bikes to be ridden on roads and bike lanes [2]. \n5. _Moving forward, COVID-19 will not pose a significant impact on transportation use._ Thus, future e-bike sales will not be affected by COVID-19. \n## **1.3 The Model** \n## **1.3.1 Developing the Model** \nIn our model, we predicted e-bike sales two and five years into the future. \nWe used a univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to determine future values in a time series based on past values. An ARIMA model is appropriate for predicting time series data and providing an accurate, reliable short-term forecast. Moreover, we have a univariate time series. Thus, a univariate ARIMA model is ideal for this problem. We will use the monthly US e-bike sale data obtained from section 0.1 as our time series data. \nIn order to use an ARIMA model, we required stationary data, which means that the mean of the series should not be a function of time. Similarly, the series \n6 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nmust have the property of homoscedasticity, meaning that the variance of the series remains constant over time [12]. \nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test is used to determine if the given data is stationary. In the ADF test, \nNull Hypothesis, _H_ 0 : The data is not stationary \nAlternate Hypothesis, _Ha_ : The data is stationary \nWhen we performed the test on the raw data, it resulted in a _p_ -value of 0 _._ 999047. Since _p > α_ = 0 _._ 05, this indicated that we failed to reject the null hypothesis (in which the data is not stationary), implying that the data was not yet stationary. To render the data stationary, we took the logarithm of the dependent variable to lower the rate at which the rolling mean changed and differenced the dependent variable to remove effects of time on the units sold(taking the difference between consecutive elements of the dataset). Performing the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test on the differenced and logarithmic data resulted in a _p_ -value of 4 _._ 204 _·_ 10 _[−]_[7] . Since _p < α_ = 0 _._ 05, we rejected the null hypothesis, meaning that an ARIMA model is appropriate for the logarithmic, order-1 differenced data. Thus, it was very likely the time series was now stationary and that the data’s statistical properties were constant over time, so an ARIMA model was further appropriate. \n**==> picture [300 x 293] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [44 x 12] intentionally omitted <==**\n**----- Start of picture text -----**<br>\nFigure 1<br>**----- End of picture text -----**<br>\n7 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nA typical ARIMA model is defined by the integer parameters ( _p, d, q_ ). _p_ is the number of autoregressive terms, _d_ is the number of differences that need to be taken for stationarity, and _q_ is the number of lagged error terms used to predict the current value [17]. \nThrough testing, we determined _p_ to have an optimal value of 12, meaning that there are 12 autoregressive terms that the model uses to compute each element of the time series. \nWe determined _d_ to have a value of 1 as first-order differencing transformed the time series into one that was stationary and removed seasonal differences. \nLastly, we gave the model a parameter value of _q_ = 1, which represents the number of lagged forecast errors that the model uses in its predictions. \n## **1.3.2 Executing the Model** \n**==> picture [376 x 200] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 2 \nWe visualized the data with log (Number of e-bikes sold in 1000s of units) versus time (in years) graph in order to show the prediction of the model. \nUsing our ARIMA model with parameters ( _p, d, q_ ) of (12 _,_ 1 _,_ 1), we predicted that, two years from now, in 2025, there would be 1 _._ 300 million e-bikes sold in the US. Additionally, five years from now, in 2028, there would be 2 _._ 113 million e-bikes sold in the US. \n## **2 Part II: Shifting Gears** \n## **2.1 Defining the Problem** \nIn this problem, we were asked to determine how certain factors affected the growth of e-bike sales in the U.S. and whether the effects of one or more of these factors was significant or not. \n## **2.2 Local Assumptions** \n1. _The popularity (”coolness”) factor is directly correlated to Google searches pertaining to electric bikes._ As interest in electric bikes increases, it follows that Google Search frequencies will also increase. \n2. _E-bike usage is only significantly impacted by environmental concerns, gas prices, per capita disposable income in the United States, and popularity._ According to our model, these are the dominant factors that comprise growth in e-bike usage. \n3. _Environmental concern can be extrapolated from those who either worry a great deal or a fair amount about the quality of the environment_ [19]. Those who worry only a little or not at all do not contribute meaningfully to environmental concerns. \n4. _Environmental concern does not change significantly throughout individual months of a year._ Environmental concerns do not change significantly throughout the months of the year, as those who worry about the quality of the environment generally do not change their opinion based on the time of year. \n5. _The most common term for e-bikes is ”electric bikes”._ When comparing the search history of e-bikes, e-bikes, and electric bikes as search terms, electric bikes had the highest proportion of searches. \n## **2.3 Variables** \nThe following variables were what we determined to be plausible significant factors in the trend of e-bike usage [19], [5]. Thus, the main factors we analyzed were disposable personal income, popularity, gas prices, and concern for the environment. \n10 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \n|**Year**|**Environmental**<br>**Concern**|**Gas Prices in**<br>**the US (USD)**|**Per capita disposable**<br>**Personal Income**<br>**in the United States,**<br>**chained(USD)**|**Google Trends**<br>**Relative Values**<br>**Annually**|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2006|0.77|2.57|37570|11.583333|\n|2007|0.76|2.8|38093|13.25|\n|2008|0.74|3.25|38188|19.083333|\n|2009|0.71|2.35|37814|13.666667|\n|2010|0.68|2.78|38282|12.583333|\n|2011|0.68|3.52|38769|12.5|\n|2012|0.73|3.62|39732|12|\n|2013|0.69|3.51|38947|11.75|\n|2014|0.66|3.36|40118|12.833333|\n|2015|0.68|2.43|41383|14.083333|\n|2016|0.73|2.14|41821|16.583333|\n|2017|0.77|2.42|42699|20|\n|2018|0.72|2.72|43886|25.416667|\n|2019|0.74|2.6|44644|30.25|\n|2020|0.69|2.17|47241|47.333333|\n|2021|0.75|3.01|48219|59.416667|\n|2022|0.71|3.95|45405|69.916667|\nTable 1 \n## **2.4 The Model** \nOf the variables analyzed, the most significant in predicting monthly US e-bike sales are disposable personal income and popularity, due to their comparatively \n12 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nlarge model coefficients (0.48 and 0.42 respectively). These factors make up 90% of the relative importance across all factors considered. \n## **3 Part III: Off the Chain** \n## **3.1 Defining the Problem** \nBased on our Monte Carlo model, we determined the quantified impact of growth in e-bike usage. The growth resulted in an average decrease of **15737.82** kilograms of CO2 emissions in 2022. Moreover, with regards to wellness, increased e-bike usage resulted in a total of **716630.727** kilo-calories burned in 2022. \n18 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \n## **References** \n- [1] Climate vermont. \n- [2] Electric bicycle state laws. \n- [3] Electric bicycles are now outselling electric cars and plug-in hybrids combined in the us. \n- [4] Global aluminum alloy market. \n- [5] Google trends: Electric bikes. \n- [6] How long do electric bikes last? \n- [7] How to charge an electric bike. \n- [8] North america e-bike market - growth, trends, covid-19 impact, and forecasts (2021 - 2026). \n- [9] The range rule for standard deviation. \n- [10] Tracing the demographics of e-bike owners in the us. \n- [11] The world footwear yearbook 2021. \n- [12] Jason Brownlee.

  "methods": "We first predicted growth in e-bike sales in the U.S. with an ARIMA model, a supervised machine-learning algorithm, that forecasts future e-bike sales based on past sales figures. This model was trained on a dataset of e-bike sales per month from January 2006 to December 2022. To obtain data for U.S. e-bike sales, we used appropriate Lagrange Interpolation on European E-Bike Sales data. Furthermore, we obtained monthly data by using Google Trends data to determine the proportion of annual sales in each month. Based on the training set, our model was able to project e-bike sales two and five years into the future as **1.3 million** units in 2025 and **2.113 million** units in 2028. \nNext, we used a Random Forest regression model to determine whether certain factors are significant reasons for the growth of e-bike usage. Such models have shown to work well in other domains i.e game theory [13] [14]. To develop this model, we isolated several variables: environmental concern, gas prices, disposable income, and e-bike popularity (quantified by Google Search Trend Data). We then generated the relative importance (model coefficients) of each factor, resulting in the most significant factors in predicting e-bike sale growth being **disposable personal income** , closely followed by **popularity** . \n## **3.2 Local Assumptions** \n1. _Most purchasers of e-bikes will be automobile users._ Those who own conventional bikes likely do so for fitness or recreational factors and thus are unlikely to purchase an e-bike. Consequently, conventional bike users who convert to e-bikes are negligible in comparison to the number of automobile users who convert. \n2. _The user does not use the bike after its expected life is fulfilled_ [6]. It is reasonable to assume that once the expected lifecycle of a e-bike is achieved, the user will no longer use this e-bike. \n3. _It’s assumed that e-bike driving miles are miles that would have been traveled by car._ Any e-bike users likely will utilize their purchase for smaller distances that would normally be traveled by car. Note that this does not imply the inverse, since longer distances will require the use of a motor vehicle. \n4. _The number of e-bikes sold prior to 2006 is negligible in comparison to the number of active e-bikes in use._ This is because the popularity of e-bikes has risen by a significant amount since 2006 and the proportion of e-bikes bought in 2006 is minimal. \n5. _Data pertinent to e-bikes from Vermont is generalized to the whole US_ . Vermont has an average temperature comparable to that of the United States [1]. This similar climate enables us to use data obtained in Vermont for the whole nation. \n6. _Any e-bikes bought will be used._ E-bikes are expensive enough that consumers investing in one will utilize it. \n7. _The standard deviation of a dataset can be reasonably approximated with the expression_ : \nmaximum _−_ minimum [9] _._ \n4 \n13 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nThis is a reasonably accurate approximation given a lack of complete data. \n## **3.3 Variables** \n**==> picture [426 x 122] intentionally omitted <==**\n**----- Start of picture text -----**<br>\nVariable Description Units Mean Standard Deviation<br>Expected e-bike lifespan, after which<br>E-bike Lifespan (LE) the user will fully replace the bike, in Months 48(23) 6<br>accordance with  Local Assumption 2 .<br>Average miles ridden per month by e-bike users that, by<br>Driving Miles (d) Local Assumption 3 , would otherwise Miles/Month 63 . 33(12) 12.02<br>have been traveled by car.<br>Car CO2 The average carbon dioxide emitted<br>Emissions (Ecar) from a car per mile driven g/Mile 431 . 2(13) 107 . 803(13)<br>E-bike CO2 The average carbon dioxide emitted<br>Emissions (Ebike) from an e-bike per mile driven g/Mile 9 . 01(24) 1.9308<br>Calories The amount of calories burned each<br>Burned Per Mile (C) mile spent riding an e-bike cals/Mile 21 3.04<br>**----- End of picture text -----**<br>\nTable 3 \n## _Note: Bracketed numbers in the table refer to citations._ \nTo calculate the value for calories burned per mile, we used the information from sources 25 and 26. From source 25, we learned that the calories burned on electric bikes range from 358 cal _/_ hr to 650 cal _/_ hr. In addition, source 26 stated that e- bike users bike approximately 24 miles _/_ hr. We used the average calories burned on electric bikes, which computed to 504 cal _/_ hr. To find the average calories burned per mile, we used the following conversion: \n**==> picture [169 x 28] intentionally omitted <==**\nFurthermore, the standard deviations lacking citations were calculated based on _Local Assumption 7_ . \n## **3.4 The Model** \nWe first used a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the effect of the increasing use of e-bikes on CO2 emissions. \nWe simulated 100 times the expected decrease, in kilograms, of CO2 emissions. To create our model, we first found the kilograms CO2 saved per mile driven with an electric bike instead of a car, yielding the following: \n**==> picture [58 x 14] intentionally omitted <==**\nWe next found the number of estimated total working bikes in the U.S. at any given point as the cumulative sum of the number of bikes sold in the last _Le_ months, calling this variable _Tb_ . Next, we multiplied the total number of bikes we have by the average number of miles ridden on an e-bike by e-bike owners in a month, _d_ to \n14 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nfind the total amount of CO2 kilograms saved every month. Thus, to find the total amount of CO2 kilograms saved every months, _TCm_ , we used the following equation: \n**==> picture [143 x 29] intentionally omitted <==**\nBy using a Monte Carlo simulation, we were able to approximate the value of each parameter by randomly sampling a value for the parameter in the normal distribution using the Mean and Standard Deviation given in Table 3. \nWe next simulated 100 times the expected number of total kilo-calories burned per month from e-bike use in the U.S. We again used _Tb · d_ to estimate the total number of miles driven by e-bikes. We then multiplied this value by the average number of calories burnt per mile riding e-bikes, giving us the total number of kilocalories burned per month from e-bike use in the U.S., _TCalm_ as \n**==> picture [97 x 29] intentionally omitted <==**\nBy using a Monte Carlo simulation, we were once again able to approximate the value of each parameter by randomly sampling a value for the parameter in the normal distribution using the Mean and Standard Deviation given in Table 3. \n## **3.5 Strengths and Weaknesses** \nThe Monte Carlo simulation does not take into account financial crises such as the 2008 recession and other unforeseen events. And, possible errors in our standard deviation calculations and means may diminish the accuracy of the model. However, it provides a good basis for quantifying the impacts of e-bikes on various factors. It allows us to reduce uncertainty by changing various parameters and viewing the impact of the factors we established. \n- [16] Aditya Gupta and Vijay Kumar Tayal.

To run \n_m r_[2] _j_ the Ljung-Box test, we used the following calculation, _Q_ ( _m_ ) = _n_ ( _n_ + 2) � _n − j_[,] _j_ =1 \n8 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nTo examine the data for outliers, we calculated the kurtosis value. Kurtosis, _N_ � _i_ =1[(] _[Y][i][ −] Y_ )[4] which can be calculated with _k_ = where _Y_ is the mean, _s_ is the _N · s_[4] standard deviation, and _N_ is the number of data points, returned 0 _._ 27. Since this value of kurtosis was relatively low ( _<_ 3), we concluded that the distribution of the data was platykurtic and that the effect of outliers on the data was insignificant. \n## **1.4 Strengths and Weaknesses** \nOur prediction is strong for short-term forecasts such as two or five years into the future, but, due to the nature of the ARIMA model, is unable to be applied to larger scales of time. The quantity of data we supplied, around 200 data points, was adequate for training an accurate ARIMA model [18]. In addition, while the _p, d,_ and _q_ values used in our model were effective, they were subjectively selected. Moreover, the model did not account for any major turn of events, as noted _Global Assumption 3._ \nOur ARIMA model yielded the following forecast. \n**==> picture [338 x 170] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 3 \n9 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nFor this problem, we will supply the variables defined in Table 1, all of which we suspect could have a role in predicting the sales of e-bikes, and train the regression on the monthly U.S. e-bike sale data from section 0.1. \nThen, we can interpret the feature importance of any given variable in the forest as its respective model coefficient. This coefficient tells us how much the incorporation of any given feature reduces the impurity (or improves the accuracy) of the model. Since this is a quantified metric, we are able to leverage it in comparing the significance of various factors in predicting the number of e-bikes sold in the U.S. \nThe average prediction error of the model was 1.27 (thousands of units) when tested on the testing data, which was randomly selected from our data set. \n## **2.4.1 Developing the Model** \nWe incorporated our variable data as features in a Random Forest, using 70% of the monthly U.S. e-bike sale dataset from section 0.1 as the training data. The remaining 30% of the monthly sale dataset is used for testing. \n11 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \nThe classification of an individual point in the monthly U.S. e-bike sale dataset as a training or testing point is done randomly until the distribution thresholds have been met so as to avoid any non-uniform bias propagation in the subsets. \n## **2.5 Strengths and Weaknesses** \nAfter training the Random Forest with the given features, we got the following model coefficient distribution. \n|**Variable**|**Computed Model Coefcient**|\n|---|---|\n|Disposable Personal Income|0.48|\n|Popularity|0.42|\n|Gas Prices|0.08|\n|Environmental Concern|0.02|\nTable 2 \n## **2.7 Sensitivity Analysis** \nWe simulate the kilograms of CO2 reductions every month in the U.S. 100 times, giving us the following figure. \n15 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \n**==> picture [272 x 213] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 4 \nWe then simulated the total number of kilo-calories burned per month from e-bike use in the U.S. 100 times, giving us the following figure. \n**==> picture [280 x 213] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 5 \n16 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \n**==> picture [152 x 195] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 6 \nFigure 6 shows one sample simulation generated by the Monte Carlo model of the kilocalories burned due to e-bikes in the U.S. in 2009 and 2022. \n**==> picture [202 x 199] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 7 \nFigure 7 shows one sample simulation generated by the Monte Carlo model of the kilograms of CO2 emissions reduced due to e-bikes in the U.S. in 2009 and 2022. \n17 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention) \n## **3.7 Sensitivity Analysis** \nSince a Monte Carlo simulation accounts for variance in original inputs by randomly selecting from a given distribution, the simulation in and of itself already takes into consideration the possible variation in input variables. Consequently, further sensitivity analysis is not necessary or useful. \n21 \nSubmission to M3 Challenge 2023 (Honorable Mention)"
