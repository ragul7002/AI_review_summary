  "abstract": "— Game companies avoid sharing their game data \nwith external researchers. Only a few research groups have \nbeen granted limited access to game data so far. The reluctance \nof these companies to make data publicly available limits the \nwide use and development of data mining techniques and \nartificial intelligence research specific to the game industry. In \nthis work, we developed and implemented an international \ncompetition on game data mining using commercial game log \ndata from one of the major game companies in South Korea: \nNCSOFT. Our approach enabled researchers to develop and \napply state-of-the-art data mining techniques to game log data \nby making the data open.",

  "methodology": "USED BY PARTICIPANTS \nA. Overview  \nThroughout the competition, various methods were \napplied and tested on the game log data of Blade & Soul of \nNCSOFT. For Track 1, there was no overriding technique. \nAll groups were evenly distributed in the rankings. This \nmeans that the combination of features, learning models, and \nfeature selection is more important than what learning model \nis used to improve churn prediction accuracy.",

  "discussion": ": POST-CONFERENCE ANALYSIS   \nA. Difficulty of the competition problems  \nChurn prediction of only loyal users differed considerably \nfrom that based on all user types. When conducting churn \nprediction targeting all users, the task becomes relatively \nstraightforward as the majority of users show obvious \nchurning signals. On the other hand, loyal users seldom \nchurn or their churn is often due to out-of-game-related \nissues, which hinders churn prediction based on in-game \nactivity data. Our comparison of performance between \npredicting churn of all users and that for loyal users only \nconfirmed that the performance differed significantly with \nrespect to prediction group targets.",
  "conclusion": "S  \nIn this paper, we propose a competition framework for \ngame data mining using commercial game log data. The goal \nof the competition was very different from other types of \ngame AI competitions that targeted strong or human-like AI \nplayers and content generators. Here, the goal of the game \ndata mining competition was to build an accurate predictor \ntrained using game log data. The first track focused on the \nclassification problem to predict churn or no churn as a \nbinary decision task. The second task involved solving a \nregression problem to predict the number of weeks that the \ngamer would survive in the future.",
