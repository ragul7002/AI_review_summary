All the codewords in such codes are subspaces of Fn\nq with a given dimension.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of list decoding of a certain family of codes in the\nGrassmannian, called lifted Gabidulin codes. For this purpose we use the Pl¨ucker embedding of\nthe Grassmannian. We describe a way of representing a subset of the Pl¨ucker coordinates of lifted\nGabidulin codes as linear block codes. The union of the parity-check equations of these block\ncodes and the equations which arise from the description of a ball around a subspace in the\nPl¨ucker coordinates describe the list of codewords with distance less than a given parameter from\nthe received word.\n1 Introduction\nLet Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of size q. The Grassmannian space (Grassmannian, in short), denoted by\nGq(k, n), is the set of all k-dimensional subspaces of the vector space Fn\nq , for any given two integers\nk and n, 0 ≤k ≤n. A subset C of the Grassmannian is called an (n, M, dS, k)q constant dimension\ncode if it has size M and minimum subspace distance dS, where the distance function in Gq(k, n)\nis deﬁned as follows:\ndS(U, V) = 2k −2 dim\n\u0000U ∩V\n\u0001\n,\n(1)\nfor any two subspaces U and V in Gq(k, n).\nThese codes gained a lot of interest due to the work by K¨otter and Kschischang [12], where\nthey show the application of such codes for error-correction in random network coding. They\nproved that an (n, M, dS, k)q code can correct any t packet errors (which is equivalent to t packet\ninsertions and t packet deletions) and any τ packet erasures introduced anywhere in the network\nas long as 4t + 2τ < dS. This application has motivated extensive work in the area [1,3,4,6,7,8,\n11,13,14,15,17,21,24,25]. In the same work the before mentioned authors gave a Singleton like\nupper bound on the size of such codes and a Reed-Solomon like code which asymptotically attains\nthis bound. Silva, K¨otter, and Kschischang [20] showed how this construction can be described\nin terms of lifted Gabidulin codes [5]. The generalizations of this construction and the decoding\nFirst and third author were partially supported by Swiss National Science Foundation Grant no. 138080.

Another type of constructions (orbit codes) can\nbe found in [4,11,24].\nIn this paper we focus on the list decoding of lifted Gabidulin codes. For the classical Gabidulin\ncodes it was recently shown by Wachter-Zeh [26] that, if the radius of the ball around a received\nword is greater than the Johnson radius, no polynomial-time list decoding is possible, since the\nlist size can be exponential. Algebraic list decoding algorithms for folded Gabidulin codes were\ndiscussed in [7,14]. The constructions of subcodes of lifted Gabidulin codes and their algebraic list\ndecoding algorithms were presented in [8,15].\nOur approach for list decoding codes in the Grassmannian is to apply the techniques of Schu-\nbert calculus over ﬁnite ﬁelds, i.e. we represent subspaces in the Grassmannian by their Pl¨ucker\ncoordinates. It was proven in [17] that a ball of a given radius (with respect to the subspace\ndistance) around a subspace can be described by explicit linear equations in the Pl¨ucker embed-\nding. In this work we describe a way of representing a subset of the Pl¨ucker coordinates of lifted\nGabidulin codes as linear block codes, which results in additional linear (parity-check) equations.\nThe solutions of all these equations will constitute the resulting list of codewords.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the construction of\nGabidulin and lifted Gabidulin codes and discuss the Pl¨ucker embedding of subspaces in the\nGrassmannian. In Section 3 we describe a representation of a subset of the Pl¨ucker coordinates\nof a lifted Gabidulin code and present a list decoding algorithm. Conclusions and problems for\nfuture research are given in Section 4.\n2 Preliminaries and Notations\nWe denote by GLn the general linear group over Fq, by Sn the symmetric group of degree n. With\nPn we denote the projective space of order n over Fq.\nLet p(x) = P pixi ∈Fq[x] be a monic and irreducible polynomial of degree ℓ, and α be a root\nof p(x). Then it holds that Fqℓ∼= Fq[α]. We denote the vector space isomorphism between the\nextension ﬁeld Fqℓand the vector space Fℓ\nq by\nφ(ℓ) :\nFqℓ−→Fℓ\nq\nℓ−1\nX\ni=0\nλiαi 7−→(λ0, . . . , λℓ−1).\nMoreover, we need the following notations: rs(U) denotes the row space of a matrix U,\n\u0012[n]\nk\n\u0013\n:= {(x1, . . . , xk) | xi ∈{1, 2, . . ., n}, x1 < · · · < xk},\nand for a matrix A we denote its i-th row by A[i], its i-th column by Ai, and the entry in the i-th\nrow and the j-th column by Ai,j.\n2.1 Lifted Gabidulin (LG) Codes\nFor two k × ℓmatrices A and B over Fq the rank distance is deﬁned by\ndR(A, B)\ndef\n= rank(A −B) .\nA [k × ℓ, ̺, δ] rank-metric code C is a linear subspace with dimension ̺ of Fk×ℓ\nq\n, in which each two\ndistinct codewords A and B have distance dR(A, B) ≥δ. For a [k × ℓ, ̺, δ] rank-metric code C it\nwas proven in [2,5,18] that\n̺ ≤min{k(ℓ−δ + 1), ℓ(k −δ + 1)} .\n(2)\n\nList Decoding of Lifted Gabidulin Codes via the Pl¨ucker Embedding\n3\nThe codes which attain this bound are called maximum rank distance codes (or MRD codes in\nshort).\nAn important family of MRD linear codes was presented by Gabidulin [5]. These codes can be\nseen as the analogs of Reed-Solomon codes for the rank metric. From now on let k ≤ℓ. A codeword\nA in a [k × ℓ, ̺, δ] rank-metric code C, can be represented by a vector cA = (c1, c2, . . . , ck), where\nci = φ(ℓ)−1(A[i]) ∈Fqℓ. Let gi ∈Fqℓ, hi ∈Fqℓ, 1 ≤i ≤k, be two sets of linearly independent\nover Fq elements. Then the generator matrix G and the parity-check matrix H of a [k × ℓ, ̺, δ]\nGabidulin MRD code are given by\nG =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng1\ng2\n. . .\ngk\ng[1]\n1\ng[1]\n2\n. . .\ng[1]\nk\ng[2]\n1\ng[2]\n2\n. . .\ng[2]\nk\n...\n...\n...\n...\ng[k−δ]\n1\ng[k−δ]\n2\n. . . g[k−δ]\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, H =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh1\nh2\n. . .\nhk\nh[1]\n1\nh[1]\n2\n. . .\nh[1]\nk\nh[2]\n1\nh[2]\n2\n. . .\nh[2]\nk\n...\n...\n...\n...\nh[δ−2]\n1\nh[δ−2]\n2\n. . . h[δ−2]\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\nwhere ̺ = ℓ(k −δ + 1), and [i] = qi [5].\nLet A be a k × ℓmatrix over Fq and let Ik be the k × k identity matrix. The matrix [Ik A] can\nbe viewed as a generator matrix of a k-dimensional subspace of Fk+ℓ\nq\n. This subspace is called the\nlifting of A [20].\nWhen the codewords of a rank-metric code C are lifted to k-dimensional subspaces, the result\nis a constant dimension code C. If C is a Gabidulin MRD code then C is called a lifted Gabidulin\n(LG) code [20].\nTheorem 1 [20] Let k, n be positive integers such that k ≤n −k. If C is a [k × (n −k), (n −\nk)(k −δ + 1), δ] Gabidulin MRD code then C is an (n, q(n−k)(k−δ+1), 2δ, k)q constant dimension\ncode.\n2.2 The Pl¨ucker Embedding\nThe basic idea of using the Pl¨ucker embedding for list decoding of subspace codes was already\nstated in [17,23]. We will now recall the main deﬁnitions and theorems from those works. The proofs\nof the results can also be found in there. For more information or a more general formulation of\nthe Pl¨ucker embedding and its applications the interested reader is referred to [9].\nLet U ∈Fk×n\nq\nsuch that its row space rs(U) describes the subspace U ∈Gq(k, n). Mi1,...,ik(U)\ndenotes the minor of U given by the columns i1, . . . , ik. The Grassmannian Gq(k, n) can be em-\nbedded into projective space using the Pl¨ucker embedding:\nϕ : Gq(k, n) −→P(\nn\nk)−1\nrs(U) 7−→[M1,...,k(U) : M1,...,k−1,k+1(U) : . . . : Mn−k+1,...,n(U)].\nThe k × k minors Mi1,...,ik(U) of the matrix U are called the Pl¨ucker coordinates of the subspace\nU. By convention, we order the minors lexicographically by the column indices.\nThe image of this embedding describes indeed a variety and the deﬁning equations of the image\nare given by the so called shuﬄe relations (see e.g. [10,16]), which are multilinear equations of\nmonomial degree 2 in terms of the Pl¨ucker coordinates:\nProposition 2 Consider x := [x1,...,k : · · · : xn−k+1,...,n] ∈P(\nn\nk)−1. Then there exists a U ∈\nGq(k, n) such that ϕ(U) = x if and only if\nX\nσ∈S2k\nsgn(σ)xσ(i1,...,ik)xσ(ik+1,...,i2k) = 0\n∀(i1, . . . , i2k) ∈\n\u0012[n]\n2k\n\u0013\n.\nThen one can easily count the number of diﬀerent shuﬄe equations.\n\n4\nAnna-Lena Trautmann et al.\nLemma 3 There are\n\u0000 n\n2k\n\u0001\nshuﬄe relations deﬁning Gq(k, n) in the Pl¨ucker embedding.\nExample 4 Gq(2, 4) is described by a single relation:\nx12x34 −x13x24 + x14x23 = 0.\nThe balls of radius 2t (with respect to the subspace distance) around some U ∈Gq(k, n) can\nbe described by explicit equations in the Pl¨ucker embedding. For it we need the Bruhat order:\n(i1, ..., ik) ≥(j1, ..., jk) ⇐⇒il ≥jl\n∀l ∈{1, . . . , k}.\nNote, that the Bruhat order is not a total but only a partial order on\n\u0000[n]\nk\n\u0001\n.\nExample 5 According to the Bruhat order it holds that (1, 2, 7) ≤(2, 3, 7). But the fact that\n(2, 4, 6) ≰(2, 3, 7) does not imply that (2, 4, 6) > (2, 3, 7). These two tuples are not comparable.\nThe equations deﬁning the balls are easily determined in the following special case:\nProposition 6 [9,17] Deﬁne U0 := rs[Ik 0k×n−k ]. Then\nB2t(U0) = {V = rs(V ) ∈Gq(k, n) | Mi1,...,ik(V ) = 0\n∀(i1, ..., ik) ̸≤(t + 1, . . . , k, n −t + 1, ..., n)}.\nWith the knowledge of B2t(U0) we can also express B2t(U) for any U ∈Gq(k, n). For this note,\nthat for any U ∈Gq(k, n) there exists an A ∈GLn such that U0A = U. Moreover,\nB2t(U0A) = B2t(U0)A.\nThe following results are taken from [17], where also the respective proofs can be found.\nFor simplifying the computations we deﬁne ¯ϕ on GLn, where we denote by A[i1, . . . , ik] the\nsubmatrix of A that consists of the rows i1, . . . , ik:\n¯ϕ : GLn −→GL(\nn\nk)\nA 7−→\n\n\n\ndet A1,...,k[1, . . . , k]\n. . .\ndet An−k+1,...,n[1, . . . , k]\n...\n...\ndet A1,...,k[n −k + 1, . . . , n] . . . det An−k+1,...,n[n −k + 1, . . . , n]\n\n\n\nLemma 7 Let U ∈Gq(k, n) and A ∈GLn. It holds that\nϕ(UA) = ϕ(U) ¯ϕ(A).\nTheorem 8 Let U = U0A ∈Gq(k, n). Then\nB2t(U) = B2t(U0A) = {V ∈Gq(k, n) | Mi1,...,ik(V ) ¯ϕ(A−1) = 0\n∀(i1, . . . , ik) ̸≤(t + 1, . . . , k, n −t + 1, ..., n)}.\nThere are always several choices for A ∈GLn such that U0A = U. Since GL(n\nk) is very large\nwe try to choose A as simple as possible. We will now explain one such construction.\nConstruction 1 For a given U = rs(U) ∈Gq(k, n) we construct A ∈GLn such that U0A = U as\nfollows:\n1. The ﬁrst k rows of A are equal to the matrix representation U of U.\n2. Find the pivot columns of U (assume that U is in RREF).\n3. Fill up the respective columns of A with zeros in the lower n −k rows.\n4. Fill up the remaining submatrix of size n −k × n −k with an identity matrix.\nThen the inverse of A can be computed as follows:\n\nList Decoding of Lifted Gabidulin Codes via the Pl¨ucker Embedding\n5\n1. Find a permutation σ ∈Sn that permutes the columns of A such that\nσ(A) =\n\u0012\nIk U ′′\n0 In−k\n\u0013\n.\n2. Then the inverse of that matrix is\nσ(A)−1 =\n\u0012\nIk −U ′′\n0 In−k\n\u0013\n.\n3. Apply σ on the rows of σ(A)−1. The result is A−1. One can easily see this if one represents σ\nby a matrix S. Then one gets (SA)−1S = A−1S−1S = A−1.\nThus, we know how to describe the balls of a given radius 2t around an element of Gq(k, n)\nwith linear equations in the Pl¨ucker embedding, which is exactly what is needed for a list decoding\nalgorithm. In the following section we will describe a way of representing a subset of the Pl¨ucker\ncoordinates of lifted rank-metric codes as linear block codes, which can then be used to come up\nwith a list decoding algorithm in the Pl¨ucker embedding.\n3 List Decoding LG Codes in the Pl¨ucker Embedding\n3.1 Linear Block Codes over Fq in the Pl¨ucker Coordinates of LG Codes\nLet C be an [k × (n −k), (n −k)(k −δ + 1, δ)] Gabidulin MRD code over Fq. Then by Theorem 1\nits lifting is a code C of size q(n−k)(k−δ+1) in the Grassmannian Gq(k, n). Let\nxA = [xA\n1...k : . . . : xA\nn−k+1...n] ∈P(\nn\nk)−1\nbe a vector which represents the Pl¨ucker coordinates of a subspace A ∈Gq(k, n). If xA is normalized\n(i.e. the ﬁrst non-zero entry is equal to one), then xA\n1...k = 1 for any A ∈C.\nLet [k] = {1, 2, . . ., k}, and let i = {i1, i2, . . . , ik} be a set of indices such that |i ∩[k]| = k −1.\nLet t ∈i, such that t > k, and s = [k] \\ i.\nLemma 9 Consider A ∈C and A = rs[ Ik A ]. If xA is normalized, then xA\ni = (−1)k−sAs,t−k.\nProof It holds that xA is normalized if its entries are the minors of the reduced row echelon form\nof A, which is [ Ik A ]. Because of the identity matrix in the ﬁrst k columns, the statement follows\ndirectly from the deﬁnition of the Pl¨ucker coordinates.\n⊓⊔\nNote, that we have to worry about the normalization since xA is projective. In the following\nwe will always assume that any element from P(\nn\nk)−1 is normalized.\nWith Lemma 9 one can easily show, that a subset of the Pl¨ucker coordinates of a lifted\nGabidulin code form a linear code over Fq:\nTheorem 10 The restriction of the set of Pl¨ucker coordinates of an (n, q(n−k)(k−δ+1), 2δ, k)q lifted\nGabidulin code C to the set {i : |i| = k, |i ∩[k]| = k −1} forms a linear code Cp over Fq of length\nk(n −k), dimension (n −k)(k −δ + 1) and minimum distance dmin ≥δ.\nProof Since C is linear, it holds that for every A, B ∈C we have A + B ∈C. Together with\nLemma 9 we have the same property when we consider the restriction of the set of Pl¨ucker\ncoordinates of a lifted Gabidulin code to the set {i : |i| = k, |i ∩[k]| = k −1}. This set is of size\nk(n −k), and therefore we obtain a linear code Cp of length k(n −k) and the same dimension\nas C, i.e. (n −k)(k −δ + 1). Since the rank of each non-zero A ∈C is greater or equal to δ, also\nthe number of non-zero entries of A has to be greater or equal to δ, hence the minimum Hamming\ndistance dmin of Cp satisﬁes dmin ≥δ.\n⊓⊔\n\n6\nAnna-Lena Trautmann et al.\nExample 11 Let α ∈F22 be a primitive element, fulﬁlling α2 = α + 1. Let C be a [2 × 2, 2, δ = 2]\nGabidulin MRD code over F2 with parity-check and generator matrices given by\nH = (1 α) and G = (α 1),\nrespectively. Hence, we want to lift C = {(bα, b) : b ∈F22}. The codewords of C, their representa-\ntion as 2 × 2 matrices, their lifting to G2(2, 4) and the respective Pl¨ucker coordinates are given in\nthe following table.\nvector representation\nmatrix representation\nlifting\nPl¨ucker coordinates\n(0, 0)\n\u00120 0\n0 0\n\u0013\n\u00121 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n\u0013\n[1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0]\n(α, 1)\n\u0012\n0 1\n1 0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0 "
