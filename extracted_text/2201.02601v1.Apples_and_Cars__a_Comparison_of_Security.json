  "introduction": "Modern cars are often referred to as “smartphone on wheels”,\nbecause the embedded systems in a car are programmed and\nconnected using similar technologies that power a smart-\nphone in a user’s pocket. Smartphones are a high-value tar-\nget of cyberattacks. Consequently, layers of security mea-\nsures are in place to protect the hardware, software, and data\nagainst a wide spectrum of threats. The system and threat\nmodel of a connected car have many similarities to a smart-\nphone. Assuming that smartphones have more advanced\nsecurity, questions arise as what are the commonalities and\ndifferences in securing a smartphone comparing to a con-\nnected car, and what can automotive security learn from it?\nIn this paper, we compare the security architecture of an\nApple iPhone[1] with that of typical connected cars.",

  "discussion": "The comparison shows that the “Apple” is several years ahead\nof the “cars”. Despite being in different product categories,\nthe security model of an iPhone from today should be the\ngoal of the cars of tomorrow. The security of iPhone char-\nacterizes a zero trust model from the silicon level up, while\ncars still follow a network-based perimeter model. As the\ncar industry evolves towards high performance vehicle com-\nputers and zone architecture, the security model needs to\nbe adapted to couple with increased system integration and\nfunction mix. iPhones demonstrate that it is technologically\nfeasible to reach a high level of security without sacrificing\nperformance and usability.",
