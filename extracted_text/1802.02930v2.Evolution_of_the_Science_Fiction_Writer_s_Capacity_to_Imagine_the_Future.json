  "abstract": "Drawing upon a body of research on the evolution of \ncreativity, this paper proposes a theory of how, when, and why \nthe forward-thinking story-telling abilities of humans \nevolved, culminating in the visionary abilities of science \nfiction writers. The ability to recursively chain thoughts \ntogether evolved approximately two million years ago. \nLanguage abilities, and the ability to shift between different \nmodes of thought, evolved approximately 100,000 years ago. \nScience fiction dates to at least the second Century AD. It is \nsuggested that well before this time, but after 100,000 years \nago, and concurrent with the evolution of a division of labour \nbetween creators and imitators there arose a division of labour \nbetween past, present, and future thinkers.",
  "introduction": "Science fiction writers possess an often uncanny ability to \nenvision the future before it happens, particularly with respect \nto technological advances. Drawing upon research in \npsychology, anthropology, archaeology, and agent-based \nmodeling, this paper offers a theory of how these abilities \nevolved. First, we look at two key cognitive transitions that \nhave been proposed to underlie the uniquely creative abilities \nof humans. Next, we examine evidence that individual \ndifferences in creativity are adaptive at the level of the social \ngroup. Third, I argue that, using analogous reasoning, we \ncould expect individual differences in the proclivity to focus \none’s thoughts along the spectrum from past, to present, to \nfuture, should also be adaptive at the level of the social group.",

  "methodology": "for analyzing \narchaeological \nremains \nare \nbecoming \nincreasingly \nsophisticated, they cannot always distinguish amongst \ndifferent theories. \n \nAgent-based modeling is a computational methodology in \nwhich artificial agents can be used to represent interacting \nindividuals. It enables us to address questions about the \nworkings of collectives such as societies. It is particularly \nvaluable for answering questions of this sort which lie at the \ninterface between anthropology and psychology, owing to the \ndifficulty of experimentally manipulating a variable, such as \nthe average amount by which one invention differs from its \npredecessor and observing its impact on cumulative culture \nover time. \n \nEVOC (for EVOlution of Culture) is a computational \nmodeling of cultural evolution that consists of neural network \nbased agents that invent new actions and imitate actions \nperformed by neighbors (Gabora 1995, 2008b).",
  "results": "obtained with it may or may \nnot have direct bearing on complex human societies, but it \nallows us to vary one parameter while holding others constant \nand thereby test hypotheses that could otherwise not be tested. \nIt provides new ways of thinking about and understand what \nis going on. \n \nThe hypothesis that cultural evolution was made possible by \nthe onset of the capacity for one thought to trigger another was \ntested in EVOC by comparing runs in which agents were \nlimited to single-step actions to runs in which they could chain \nideas together to generate multi-step actions (Gabora, Chia, \nand Firouzi, 2013; Gabora and Smith, submitted). Chaining \nincreased the mean fitness and diversity of cultural outputs \nacross the artificial society (Gabora, Chia, and Firouzi, 2013). \nWhile chaining and no-chaining runs both converged on \noptimal actions, without chaining this set was static, but with \nchaining it was in constant flux as ever-fitter actions were \nfound.",

  "conclusion": "The ‘divide and conquer’ strategy is well-known to Mother \nNature, and it has previously been suggested that its \neffectiveness can account for individual differences in human \ncreativity. Using a similar argument, this paper suggested that \nindividual differences in the tendency to focus one’s thoughts \non the past, present, or future, became magnified over time. \nThis in turn paved the way for forward-thinking science \nfiction writers and their often uncanny powers to envision \ntechnological advances before they become reality. \n \nFUTURE RESEARCH \nThis account, though built on an extensive foundation of \nresearch in psychology, anthropology, archaeology, and \nagent-based modeling, is at this point speculative. In future \nagent-based model work we will investigate the extent to \nwhich a division of labour into past, present, and future \nfocused modes of cognition exists and is in fact beneficial to \na social group.",
