  "abstract": ". A classical result by Kreweras (1965) allows one to compute the number of plane\npartitions of a given skew shape and bounded parts as certain determinants. We prove that\nthese determinants expand as polynomials with nonnegative coefficients. This result can be\nreformulated in terms of order polynomials of cell posets of skew shapes, and explains im-\nportant positivity phenomena about the Ehrhart polynomials of shard polytopes, matroids,\nand order polytopes. Among other applications, we generalize a positivity statement from\nSchubert calculus by Fomin and Kirillov (1997) from straight shapes to skew shapes.\nWe\nshow that all shard polytopes are Ehrhart positive and, stronger, that all fence posets, includ-\ning the zig-zag poset, and all circular fence posets have order polynomials with nonnegative\ncoefficients.",

The positivity of the coefficients of\nΩ(P; t) is even more rare, in the sense that one can find posets on 5 elements (for example, an\nantichain of size 4 covered by one element) attaining a negative coefficient.\n1.2. Cell posets of skew shapes. The central result of this article establishes the nonnega-\ntivity of the order polynomials of the cell posets of arbitrary skew shapes. In other words, we\nprove the following statement.\nTheorem 1.1 (Main Theorem 4.2) Let λ/µ be a skew shape of size n.",
