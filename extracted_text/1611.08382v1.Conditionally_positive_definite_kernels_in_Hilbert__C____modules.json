  "abstract": ". We investigate the notion of conditionally positive deﬁnite in the\ncontext of Hilbert C∗-modules and present a characterization of the condi-\ntionally positive deﬁniteness in terms of the usual positive deﬁniteness. We\ngive a Kolmogorov type representation of conditionally positive deﬁnite ker-\nnels in Hilbert C∗-modules.\nAs a consequence, we show that a C∗-metric\nspace (S, d) is C∗-isometric to a subset of a Hilbert C∗-module if and only if\nK(s, t) = −d(s, t)2 is a conditionally positive deﬁnite kernel. We also present\na characterization of the order K′ ≤K between conditionally positive deﬁnite\nkernels.\n1.",
