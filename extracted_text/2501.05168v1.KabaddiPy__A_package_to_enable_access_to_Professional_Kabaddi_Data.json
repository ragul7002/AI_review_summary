  "abstract": "Kabaddi, a contact team sport of Indian origin, has seen a dramatic rise in global popularity, highlighted by\nthe upcoming Kabaddi World Cup in 2025 with over sixteen international teams participating, alongside flourishing\nnational leagues such as the Indian Pro Kabaddi League (230 million viewers) and the British Kabaddi League.\nWe present the first open-source Python module to make Kabaddi statistical data easily accessible from multiple\nscattered sources across the internet. The module was developed by systematically web-scraping and collecting\nteam-wise, player-wise and match-by-match data. The data has been cleaned, organized, and categorized into team\noverviews and player metrics, each filterable by season. The players are classified as raiders and defenders, with\ntheir best strategies for attacking, counter-attacking, and defending against different teams highlighted. Our module\nenables continuous monitoring of exponentially growing data streams, aiding researchers to quickly start building\nupon the data to answer critical questions, such as the impact of player inclusion/exclusion on team performance,\nscoring patterns against specific teams, and break down opponent gameplay.",
  "introduction": "Kabaddi is a fast-paced team-contact sport, that has been rapidly gaining international recognition and popularity.\nIn a game that can be loosely described as a combination of rugby, American football and tag (1) two teams take\nturns sending a player, called the “raider” into the opponent’s half with the goal of tagging as many defenders as\npossible and returning to their own side without being tackled. The raider must accomplish this in a single breath for\nan offense lasting 30 seconds, all the while chanting “kabaddi” (pronounced kuh-bud-DEE).\nSimilar to American football, where the offense aims to evade the opponent’s defense to score touchdowns,\nthe raider in Kabaddi must dodge the defender’s tackles, tag them and return to their own half to score points.\nMeanwhile the defense must work in coordination, aiming to tackle and immobilize the raider before they can return.\nUnlike football, Kabaddi requires no ball or protective gear; it’s a minimalist sport that focuses purely on strategy\nand physical strength.\nOriginally a traditional Indian sport, Kabaddi was first exhibited at the 1936 Berlin Olympics (2). Since becoming\na regular feature in the Asian Games in 1990 (3), the sport has gained international recognition, as witnessed by the\nlaunch of the Kabaddi World Cup in 2004, with England set to host the 2025 edition (4, 5). The sport’s popularity\nskyrocketed with the inception of the Indian Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) in 2014, now attracting 230 million viewers,\nsecond only to cricket’s Indian Premier League (IPL).\nWith success of the PKL, several regional leagues, like the European Kabaddi Championship and the British\nKabaddi League, have emerged and over 30 nations have established dedicated national Kabaddi teams including\nthe United States (6), Japan, South Korea and Iran.\nFor a game rooted in strategy, which has witnessed growing viewership across the board, and its highly\ncommercial nature - Star Sports bought the media rights for PKL for $120 million for five years (7), Kabaddi is\nan overlooked sport. It still lacks the analytical infrastructure seen in other sports such as hockey, basketball or\nfootball (8).",
