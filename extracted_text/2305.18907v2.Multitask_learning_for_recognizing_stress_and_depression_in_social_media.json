  "results": "and compare our approaches with existing research initiatives,\nsingle-task learning, and transfer learning. Experiments show multiple advantages of our approaches\nover state-of-the-art ones.\n1. Introduction\nThe World Health Organization (WHO)1 states that\naround 280 million people in the world suffer from depres-\nsion. Specifically, depression comes with a loss of pleasure\nor interest for a long period of time.",
  "conclusion": "In this paper, we introduced two architectures to detect\nstressful and depressive posts in social media through a\nmulti-task learning framework. Each multi-task learning\nframework consists of two tasks, namely the primary task\nand the auxiliary one. We defined the primary task as the de-\npression detection task, while the stress prediction task cor-\nresponds to the auxiliary task. In terms of the first approach,\neach stressful and depressive post pass through a shared\nBERT layer, which is updated by both tasks."
