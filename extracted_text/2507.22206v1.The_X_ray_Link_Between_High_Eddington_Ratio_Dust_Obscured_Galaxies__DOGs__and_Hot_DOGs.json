  "abstract": "Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with extremely red optical-to-infrared colors are often associated with intense starburst and AGN activity. Studying DOGs can provide insights into the processes that drive the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. However, the general DOG population is heterogeneous, spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages, and has X-ray obscuring column densities ( _N_ H) covering lowto-high levels. In this work, we focus on seven high Eddington ratio DOGs (log λEdd ≳ −0.5) to examine their X-ray obscuration properties using new and archival X-ray observations. We confirm that these systems are generally heavily obscured, with 6/7 having _N_ H ≳ 10[23] cm[−][2] and 3/7 having _N_ H ≳ 10[24] cm[−][2] . Based on the observed similarity with the rare Hot DOG population, we argue that both high-λEdd DOGs and Hot DOGs likely trace the post-merger phase during which AGNs are enshrouded by large columns of dust-rich material. \n_Keywords:_ Active galactic nuclei (16) — Galaxy evolution (594) — AGN host galaxies (2017)",
  "introduction": "Within the coevolution framework of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies (e.g., D. B. Sanders et al. 1988; P. F. Hopkins et al. 2006, 2008; D. M. Alexander & R. C. Hickox 2012), major mergers of gas-rich galaxies can trigger intense starburst activity and drive material toward the central SMBHs, fueling accretion. The peak activity of both SMBH accretion and star formation occurs during dust-enshrouded, heavily obscured phases, with the (obscured) SMBH accretion approaching the Eddington limit (e.g., D. Narayanan et al. 2010; E. Treister et al. 2010; G. B. Lansbury et al. 2015; F. Vito et al. 2018). Subsequently, radiation-driven outflows from near the central SMBH sweep away the obscuring material (“blow-out” phase; e.g., P. F. Hopkins & M. Elvis 2010; A. C. Fabian 2012 and references therein), allowing the SMBH to manifest as an unobscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). \nHot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) and DOGs have been suggested to represent key post-merger evolutionary phases. Both are selected observationally for their extremely red optical and/or infrared (IR) colors (A. Dey et al. 2008; P. R. M. Eisenhardt et al. 2012; Y. Toba & T. Nagao 2016; Y. Toba et al. 2017; J. Wu et al. 2012, 2018), potentially",
  "results": "DOGs are typically selected with 24 µm fluxes _f_ 24 µm ≥ 0.3 mJy and _R_ -band to 24 µm colors ( _R_ − [24])Vega ≥ 14 (A. Dey et al. 2008). Y. Toba & T. Nagao (2016) additionally applied a criterion of _f_ 22 µm ≥ 3.8 mJy and _i_ − [22] ≥ 7 to select IR-bright DOGs, which tend to have larger AGN contributions. DOGs are generally less extreme, characterized by less-massive SMBHs and larger host-galaxy contributions, and they have smaller intrinsic 2 − 10 keV luminosities ( _L_ X) compared to the rarer Hot DOGs. Compared to Hot DOGs, DOGs are more common and representative in the Universe. Numerically, the surface number density of DOGs on the sky can reach ≈ 300 deg[−][2] in deep fields (e.g., A. Dey et al. 2008; Z. Yu et al. 2024), but the surface num- \nEmail: fanzou01@gmail.com \n2 \nber density of Hot DOGs is four orders of magnitude lower (≈ 0.03 deg[−][2] ; P. R. M. Eisenhardt et al. 2012; J. Wu et al. 2012). \nX-ray observations provide unique insights into the nature of (Hot) DOGs. One of the primary advantages of X-rays is their high penetration power, which enables the direct identification of AGNs buried in large column densities ( _N_ H) of obscuring material. Studies have found that Hot DOGs exhibit high _L_ X with nearly Compton-thick obscuration (D. Stern et al. 2014; R. J. Assef et al. 2016, 2020; C. Ricci et al. 2017a; F. Vito et al. 2018; L. Zappacosta et al. 2018). Notably, F. Vito et al. (2018) concluded that Hot DOGs occupy a distinct region in the _N_ H − _L_ X plane, characterized by much higher _N_ H than luminous red type 1 quasars, which are thought to be transitioning from a heavily obscured phase to an unobscured blue-quasar phase. \nHowever, the X-ray obscuration of DOGs spans a wider _N_ H range than that of Hot DOGs (G. Lanzuisi et al. 2009; A. Corral et al. 2016; L. A. Riguccini et al. 2019; N. Cristello et al. 2024; A. Kayal & V. Singh 2024; Z. Yu et al. 2024). This suggests that the DOG population may be heterogeneous, potentially covering a wide range of evolutionary stages or even sometimes be explained by episodes of star formation, as concluded in Z. Yu et al. (2024) based on studying a large sample of well-characterized DOGs. Z. Yu et al. (2024) also demonstrated that the general DOG population is not primarily driven by major mergers and that typical AGNcontaining DOGs are analogous to extreme type 2 AGNs instead of Hot DOGs. However, F. Zou et al. (2020) argued that high-λEdd DOGs naturally tend to be close to the dustenshrouded phase after major mergers and, like Hot DOGs, are likely heavily obscured in X-rays. We note that previously identified DOG samples rarely reach _N_ H ≳ 10[23][.][5] cm[−][2] , implying that heavily obscured DOGs (i.e., the analogs of Hot DOGs) may be severely underrepresented. The few reported heavily obscured DOGs (e.g, Y. Toba et al. 2020; F. Zou et al. 2020; N. Cristello et al. 2024) indeed also have high λEdd. \nTo further constrain the X-ray obscuration levels of highλEdd DOGs, we compile seven DOGs with known high λEdd values that are comparable to those of Hot DOGs (generally having −0.5 ≲ log λEdd ≲ 0.5; e.g., G. Li et al. 2024) and target four of them with Chandra observations in this work. The detailed sample selection will be presented in Section 2. We will probe if our sources are indeed heavily obscured, as has been seen for Hot DOGs, in Section 3. We adopt a flat ΛCDM cosmology with _H_ 0 = 70 km s[−][1] Mpc[−][1] , ΩΛ = 0.7, and Ω _M_ = 0.3. For simplicity, we will write SDSS Jhhmmss.ss±ddmmss.s as Jhhmm±ddmm in the main text. We will use _L_ X and _L_ X,obs to represent intrinsic and observed − (i.e., without absorption corrections) 2 10 keV luminosities, \nrespectively, unless otherwise noted. We will always adopt cm[−][2] as the unit of _N_ H. \n## 2. SAMPLE SELECTION \nOur sample is primarily drawn from the high-λEdd DOG sample in F. Zou et al. (2020), which was initially from Y. Toba & T. Nagao (2016) and Y. Toba et al. (2017). Y. Toba et al. (2017) systematically selected 36 IR-bright DOGs with ( _i_ −[22])AB > 7, 22 µm flux densities above 3.8 mJy, and clear [O iii] from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Among them, F. Zou et al. (2020) further selected sources with broad Mg ii or Hβ lines and targeted 12 DOGs with Cycle 20 Chandra snapshot observations (≈ 3 ks per source). The goal of selecting broad-line DOGs is to measure their black-hole masses ( _M_ BH), and, consequently, λEdd, based on their broad-line widths by assuming a virial equilibrium in the broad-line region. Measuring _M_ BH also requires intrinsic, deabsorbed AGN optical or UV luminosities (e.g., Y. Shen 2013). These were derived from SED fitting by recovering the deabsorbed AGN SED components, as has been done in F. Zou et al. (2020), and such techniques have also been implemented to measure _M_ BH values for Hot DOGs (e.g., G. Li et al. 2024). F. Zou et al. (2020) showed that these 12 DOGs generally have high λEdd and utilized Cycle 20 Chandra observations to examine their basic X-ray obscuration properties. All three targets with λEdd < 0.1 were X-ray-detected, but only 3 out of 9 sources with λEdd > 0.1 were detected. At least at face value, the lower detection rates at higher λEdd may suggest that high-λEdd DOGs are more obscured. However, the short Chandra exposures in F. Zou et al. (2020) hindered more effective constraints on the X-ray absorption columns of highλEdd DOGs. \nTo further improve the constraints on high-λEdd DOGs, we conducted follow-up X-ray observations with longer exposure. Given our available follow-up resources, we focus on the six DOGs with the higher half of λEdd in the sample of F. Zou et al. (2020) (log λEdd ≳ −0.5) as they are more representative of the extreme high-λEdd DOG population. As shown in G. Li et al. (2024), the λEdd of Hot DOGs is mainly distributed across −0.5 ≲ log λEdd ≲ 0.5 (see their Figures 6 and 7), and thus DOGs below log λEdd ≲ −0.5 in F. Zou et al. (2020) are not formally high-λEdd DOGs with λEdd comparable to Hot DOGs. Besides, we do not have new observations of these lower-λEdd DOGs and thus do not have effective constraints on their _N_ H. Therefore, the remaining DOGs with lower λEdd in F. Zou et al. (2020) will not be discussed in this work. \nWe have obtained a 68 ks follow-up XMM-Newton observation for the X-ray brightest source in the sample, J1324+4501, confirming its heavily obscured nature with log _N_ H = 23.43[+] −[0] 0[.] .[09] 13[(][N. Cristello et al. 2024][). In this work,] we obtained longer Cycle 25 Chandra exposures (≈ 15 ks \n3 \nper source) for the four fainter sources, where the exposures are set to ensure that, even if these sources are undetected, the corresponding X-ray upper limits are sufficiently tight to confirm the heavily obscured nature. This work presents the new Chandra observations and combines these newly observed sources with the archival ones to provide constraints on the X-ray obscuration levels of high-λEdd DOGs. \nIn this section, we will first present the new Chandra observations (Section 3.1) and _N_ H constraints (Section 3.2) for four sources in our sample and then combine them with the remaining three archival sources in our sample to discuss the implications for high-λEdd DOGs (Section 3.3). \n## 3.1. _Chandra Data Reduction_ \nTo assess whether the sources are detected, we calculate the binomial no-source probability _PB_ (P. S. Broos et al. 2007; M. C. Weisskopf et al. 2007). We set a detection threshold of _PB_ = 0.01, suitable for sources with known locations. By combining data from Cycle 20 and Cycle 25 observations, we successfully detected J1210+6105 (3 sourceregion counts) and J1235+4827 (17 source-region counts), with _PB_ = 1 × 10[−][3] and 2 × 10[−][26] , respectively; J1042+2451 and J1513+1451 are not detected. \n4 \n**Table 1.** Source Properties. \n|SDSS Name|_z_|log_M_BH|logλEdd|log_L_X,obs|log_L_X|log_N_H|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||(_M_⊙)||(erg s−1)|(erg s−1)|(cm−2)|\n|(1)|(2)|(3)|(4)|(5)|(6)||\n|J104241.10+245107.0|1.026|8.80±0.15|−0.48±0.16|<42.8|44.4+0.3<br>−0.4|>24.0|\n|J121056.92+610551.5|0.926|7.89±0.33|−0.11±0.35|42.5+0.3<br>−0.2|43.6+0.8<br>−0.4|23.3+1.6<br>−0.9|\n|J123544.97+482715.4|1.023|8.20±0.12|−0.60±0.08|43.4+0.1<br>−0.1|43.8+0.1<br>−0.1|<22.5|\n|J151354.48+145125.2|0.882|8.15±0.12|−0.33±0.16|<42.5|44.1+0.3<br>−0.5|>23.9|\n|J082501.48+300257.1⋆|0.890|8.40_a_|−0.15_a_|44.1|44.6+0.2<br>−0.2|24.0+0.3<br>−0.2|\n|J132440.17+450133.8⋆|0.774|8.27±0.40|−0.06±0.40|44.11+0.05<br>−0.04|44.71+0.08<br>−0.12|23.43+0.09<br>−0.13|\n|J152504.74+123401.7⋆|0.851|8.36±0.23|−0.51±0.24|43.3+0.2<br>−0.2|44.3+0.3<br>−0.3|23.2+0.3<br>−0.3|\n_Notes._ (2) Redshifts.

  "conclusion": "We summarize the properties of our sources in Table 1. The X-ray properties are either from the literature (the last three rows of the table) or will be derived in Section 3.2 (the first four rows of the table). For sources other than J0825+3002, the _M_ BH and λEdd are from Table 4 in F. Zou et al. (2020) and are all derived from broad Mg ii lines. For J0825+3002, its _M_ BH is based on the scaled host stellar mass, as reported in Section 3.3 of Y. Toba et al. (2020). \n**==> picture [228 x 167] intentionally omitted <==**\n**----- Start of picture text -----**<br>\n45.0<br>44.5<br>44.0<br>43.5<br>43.0<br>42.5<br>42.0<br>43.0 43.5 44.0 44.5 45.0 45.5 46.0<br>log L6 m (erg s 1)<br>)<br>1<br>s<br>g<br>r<br>e<br>(<br>bs<br>Xo,<br>L<br>g<br>lor<br>o<br>X<br>L<br>g<br>lo<br>**----- End of picture text -----**<br>\n**Figure 1.** _L_ X vs. _L_ 6 µm for our sample, in larger open circles [downward triangles] representing detected [undetected] sources, and for the DOG sample of A. Corral et al. (2016) and Z. Yu et al. (2024), shown as orange filled circles. The red open circles or triangles represent _L_ X,obs for all of our sources, while the blue circles represent _L_ X for 4/7 of them; red and blue circles for the same sources are connected with vertical gray lines. All the orange circles are for _L_ X. These orange circles are mostly not heavily obscured, and thus their intrinsic _L_ X and _L_ X,obs only differ slightly, with a median offset of 0.2 dex. For comparison, the relation derived by D. Stern (2015) is shown as a solid black line, whereas the dashed black line illustrates the extent to which the relation is suppressed if _N_ H = 10[24] cm[−][2] . The _L_ X values of general DOGs and those in our sample are consistent with the AGN _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation. The _L_ X,obs values of our sample, on the other hand, are strongly suppressed compared to the relation, possibly indicating heavy X-ray obscuration. \nto be from AGN SEDs because AGNs are much redder than galaxies in the mid-IR. Figure 3 in F. Zou et al. (2020) also showed that strong AGN components are present in the midIR. \nWith the limited number of counts, we cannot simultaneously constrain _L_ X and _N_ H for the newly observed sources. Therefore, we focus on measuring _N_ H under the assumption that our sources follow the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation within a reasonable scatter. The spectral analyses are conducted with `BXA` (J. Buchner et al. 2014) and `Sherpa` (A. Siemiginowska et al. 2024); the spectra are modeled with `phabs` × `(borus01+zphabs` × `cabs` × `cutoffpl)` , where `phabs` represents the Galactic absorption, `borus01` is the reprocessed spherical torus emission model of M. Balokovi´c et al. (2018), `zphabs` × `cabs` models the source intrinsic absorption with Compton-scattering losses, and `cutoffpl` models the X-ray continuum. Since our sources may be in the dust-enshrouded phase, it is appropriate to adopt a covering factor of unity for the `borus01` model. Note that the `borus01` component only becomes important when _N_ H ≫ 10[24] cm[−][2] , and thus its detailed geometry has little impact on the qualitative inference of the heavy-obscuration nature of \n6 \nour sources. We fix the average _N_ H of the torus to 10[24] cm[−][2] and use the inferred _N_ H values of `zphabs` and `cabs` to represent the line-of-sight _N_ H. We fix the `cutoffpl` powerlaw index and cut-off energy to Γ = 2 and 500 keV, respectively. The two free parameters of the model are thus _N_ H and _L_ X. We adopt a flat prior for line-of-sight log _N_ H within 20 ≤ log _N_ H ≤ 26 and a normal prior for log _L_ X centered at the _L_ 6 µm-predicted values. The standard deviation (≈ 0.5 dex) of the log _L_ X prior accounts for the intrinsic scatter of the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation (0.4 dex) and the _L_ 6 µm uncertainties. Note that we are not placing the assumed _L_ X exactly on the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation; instead, the prior dispersion still allows _L_ X to deviate away by one dex within the 2σ range of the prior. \nWe deliberately adopted a physically motivated, weakly informative prior for _L_ X because, as mentioned earlier, we would like to measure how much the obscuration level needs to reach to explain the low _L_ X,obs _if_ our sources follow the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation within a reasonable scatter. This is a both necessary and reasonable assumption. The necessity is based on the fact that our sources are limited in counts, and thus it is infeasible to simultaneously constrain _L_ X and _N_ H for, at least, J1042+2451, J1210+6105, and J1513+1451, which have less than three counts each. We can only constrain one of these two parameters (or their limits) after assuming the other one. Our adopted assumption is also reasonable. We have verified that both DOG samples in A. Corral et al. (2016) and Z. Yu et al. (2024) are in good consistency with our prior, as can be visually seen in Figure 1 – both samples have a dispersion of 0.38 dex around the expected _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation in D. Stern (2015) and a much smaller median offset. Besides, as shown in Figure 1, the intrinsic _L_ X of 4/7 sources in our sample are in good consistency with the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation. As discussed earlier in this section, previous works also reported that both DOGs and Hot DOGs, either individually or as a sample, are not too far away from the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation (e.g, C. Ricci et al. 2017a; F. Vito et al. 2018; L. Zappacosta et al. 2018; Y. Toba et al. 2020; N. Cristello et al. 2024; Z. Yu et al. 2024). \nThe sampling of the posterior probability distributions is conducted with `BXA` , which has internally implemented the nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm in the `UltraNest` package, as presented in J. Buchner (2021). We integrate out _L_ X and show the sampled marginal line-of-sight _N_ H posterior distributions in Figure 2. The _N_ H posterior of J1235+4827 has an apparent peak at log _N_ H ≈ 23.3. The posteriors of J1042+2451 and J1513+1451 are small at low _N_ H and reach plateaus at high _N_ H, and thus we can constrain their _N_ H lower limits. In contrast, J1235+4827 has an _N_ H upper limit. Appendix A also shows that the posteriors are generally robust against reasonable changes of the prior. These _N_ H measurements are reported in Table 1 together with the \nother three high-λEdd DOGs (J0825+3002, J1324+4501, and J1525+1234) from Y. Toba et al. (2020), F. Zou et al. (2020), and N. Cristello et al. (2024). The X-ray spectra of these literature-reported DOGs generally have much higher constraining power, and thus their measurements will remain similar no matter if we apply the log _L_ X prior to their data. Table 1 indicates that most of our sources are heavily obscured, potentially reaching a Compton-thick level. \nTable 1 presents the inferred intrinsic _L_ X. The measurements for J1042+2451, J1210+6105, and J1513+1451 are influenced by the prior, which is evident from the large uncertainties in _L_ X. The intrinsic _L_ X values of the remaining sources better reflect the X-ray data constraints. \n## 3.3. _The N_ H − _L_ X _and N_ H − λEdd _Planes_ \nWe display all of our seven sources in the _N_ H − _L_ X plane in Figure 3. For comparison, we also plot red type 1 quasars (T. Urrutia et al. 2005; S. Martocchia et al. 2017; G. Mountrichas et al. 2017; A. D. Goulding et al. 2018; G. B. Lansbury et al. 2020), Hot DOGs (D. Stern et al. 2014; R. J. Assef et al. 2016; C. Ricci et al. 2017a; F. Vito et al. 2018; L. Zappacosta et al. 2018), and DOGs (G. Lanzuisi et al. 2009; A. Corral et al. 2016; Z. Yu et al. 2024). Our sources have _L_ X values comparable to other DOGs, but they appear to be generally more obscured, with 6 out of 7 of our sample having _N_ H ≳ 10[23] cm[−][2] . Three of our sources—J0825+3002, J1042+2451, and J1513+1451—reside in the Compton-thick regime, a region that is largely unoccupied by other DOGs. Such a difference also exists between the higher-luminosity Hot DOGs versus red type 1 quasars, suggesting the possible physical link between high-λEdd DOGs and Hot DOGs. \nFurthermore, the _N_ H − λEdd plane also serves as a useful diagram relevant to AGN-driven outflows (e.g., W. Ishibashi et al. 2018). Recall that the classical Eddington limit is defined for pure ionized hydrogen and only includes the electron scattering cross-section. Real astronomical systems, however, usually have dusty gas instead, and dusts have a much higher overall absorption cross-section compared to gas. A. C. Fabian et al. (2006) introduced the term “ _e_ ff _ective_ Eddington limit” to account for the dust absorption cross section, where AGNs with effective Eddington limits above the unity are expected to generate outflows. As detailed in W. Ishibashi et al. (2018), the effective Eddington limit can be expressed as a function of λEdd and _N_ H, and the curve of an effective Eddington limit of unity divides the _N_ H − λEdd plane into a “forbidden region” (also known as the outflow region) and an “allowed region” (e.g., D. Kakkad et al. 2016; C. Ricci et al. 2017b; W. Ishibashi et al. 2018, 2021). Longlived, obscuring clouds can only survive in the high- _N_ H allowed region, where the obscuring material is sufficiently massive to withstand radiation pressure. Figure 4 presents the two regions in the _N_ H − λEdd plane.

Our sources are plotted as large blue circular points or triangles, where the downward (upward) triangles represent _N_ H upper (lower) limits. The gray-shaded region is the allowed region for long-lived clouds, and the black solid (dashed) curves represent the boundaries between the allowed region and the outflow region at the single-scattering (radiation-trapping) limit (see W. Ishibashi et al. 2018 and further descriptions in Section 3.3). The yellow region represents obscuration possibly caused by host galaxies (C. Ricci et al. 2017b). The purple points are the sources with strong outflows, the green points represent red type 1 quasars, and the red shaded region is the expected region for Hot DOGs (C. Ricci et al. 2017a; F. Vito et al. 2018; J. Wu et al. 2018; G. Li et al. 2024). \n**Figure 3.** The _N_ H − _L_ X plane. Our sources are plotted as large blue circular points or triangles, where the leftward (rightward) triangles represent _N_ H upper (lower) limits. The green, orange, and red points are red type 1 quasars, DOGs, and Hot DOGs, respectively. \ntween the two regions depends on the IR optical depth of the absorbing material (W. Ishibashi & A. C. Fabian 2015). In the single-scattering limit (i.e., the black solid curve in Figure 4), the medium is optically thick to UV but optically thin to IR such that UV photons are absorbed while reemitted IR photons would escape freely. In the radiation-trapping limit (i.e., the black dashed curve in Figure 4), the medium is optically thick to both UV and IR, and thus the reemitted IR photons would undergo multiple scatterings and exert larger momentum, leading to a larger forbidden region. Besides the medium in the vicinity of SMBHs, larger-scale dust lanes in their host galaxies may also cause some X-ray absorptions, but the corresponding _N_ H should be generally small. We fol- \nlow C. Ricci et al. (2017b) and W. Ishibashi et al. (2018) and adopt a nominal limit of _N_ H ≤ 10[22] cm[−][2] (see Figure 3 in C. Ricci et al. 2017b) for the dust lanes (i.e., the yellow region in Figure 4). \nWe present our sources in the _N_ H − λEdd plane in Figure 4 together with sources with strong outflows (M. Brusa et al. 2015; D. Kakkad et al. 2016), red quasars (S. M. LaMassa et al. 2016, 2017; E. Glikman et al. 2017; G. B. Lansbury et al. 2020), and Hot DOGs (C. Ricci et al. 2017a; F. Vito et al. 2018; J. Wu et al. 2018; G. Li et al. 2024). Unlike AGNs \n8 \nwith strong outflows, our high-λEdd DOGs and the Hot DOGs share a similar region in the _N_ H−λEdd plane and mainly reside at the boundary between the allowed region and the outflow region. Indeed, F. Zou et al. (2020) demonstrated that highλEdd DOGs exhibit only moderate outflows, characterized by outflow-broadened [O iii] widths of ≲ 1000 km s[−][1] , which are narrower compared to sources with strong outflows (M. Brusa et al. 2015; G. B. Lansbury et al. 2020). From this, we conclude that both high-λEdd DOGs and Hot DOGs are still in the process of entering the blow-out phase, during which strong AGN outflows start to expel the obscuring materials. \nWe note that J1235+4827, which has the smallest λEdd in our sample, is the only source that is not heavily obscured in X-rays. This source thus does not share the similarities with Hot DOGs and may not be in the dust-enshrouded phase after gas-rich galaxy mergers. \nIn this work, we present new Chandra observations of 4 high-λEdd DOGs (log λEdd ≳ −0.5) and combine them with archival observations for 3 other high-λEdd DOGs to probe their X-ray obscuration levels. We found that their _L_ X,obs all lie below the expected _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation. Based on the prior knowledge that both DOGs and Hot DOGs are not strongly intrinsically X-ray weak, we argue that the low _L_ X,obs is caused by heavy obscuration. We further constrain the _N_ H with the inclusion of physically motivated log _L_ X priors constructed based on the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation. We find that these systems are generally heavily obscured, with 6/7 having _N_ H ≳ 10[23] cm[−][2] and 3/7 having _N_ H ≳ 10[24] cm[−][2] . \nPrevious work (F. Zou et al. 2020) established that highλEdd DOGs share several important similarities with Hot DOGs: (i) their central SMBHs have high accretion rates; (ii) they are still entering the blow-out phase and do not have sufficiently strong outflows to sweep away large column densities of enshrouded materials; (iii) they are associated to intense host-galaxy starbursts. This work confirms that highλEdd DOGs, similar to Hot DOGs, are also heavily obscured in X-rays, potentially up to a Compton-thick level. These properties are consistent with the peak phase of AGN obscuration and SMBH and galaxy growth after gas-rich galaxy mergers and suggest that high-λEdd DOGs and Hot DOGs are at similar evolutionary stages. \nNevertheless, as argued in previous works (e.g., Z. Yu et al. 2024), DOGs may originate from a heterogeneous popula-",
  "methods": "Toba et al. (2020) and F. Zou et al. (2020) by decomposing the corresponding spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The three archival sources (J0825+3002, J1324+4501, and J1525+1234) have reported intrinsic, deabsorbed 2 − 10 keV luminosities _L_ X (Y. Toba et al. 2020; F. Zou et al. 2020; N. Cristello et al. 2024). With our new observations, J1235+4827 also has sufficient counts to allow basic _L_ X measurements (see the latter part of this section). Therefore, we also plot intrinsic _L_ X values for these four sources in the figure. For comparison, we display the expected AGN _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation from D. Stern (2015) and _L_ X of typical DOGs reported by A. Corral et al. (2016) and Z. Yu et al. (2024). The goal of presenting intrinsic _L_ X instead of _L_ X,obs \n## 3.2. _N_ H _Measurements_ \nWe convert the net counts to _L_ X,obs using a power-law model with Γ = 1.4 and the extracted Chandra response files. Figure 1 illustrates the comparison between _L_ X,obs and the AGN 6 µm luminosities, _L_ 6 µm = ν _L_ ν(6 µm), for the entire sample. The _L_ 6 µm values were estimated by Y. \n5 \nfor these typical DOGs is to help evaluate if DOGs follow the AGN _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation. The relation in D. Stern (2015) was empirically constructed for typical AGNs and was shown to be applicable over six orders of magnitude in _L_ X. Those AGNs with _L_ X,obs significantly below the relation may have X-ray emission suppressed by heavy obscuration. For visual guidance, we also plot the expected suppressed _L_ X,obs − _L_ 6 µm relation when _N_ H = 10[24] cm[−][2] in the figure, i.e., moving the original _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation downward by 1.5 dex. \nThe _L_ X values of typical DOGs generally align with the expected relation. Similarly, for the plotted four DOGs with _L_ X measurements in our sample, their _L_ X values also agree well with the expected relation. However, all the _L_ X,obs of our DOGs fall significantly below this relation, suggesting that their X-ray emission may be heavily suppressed by strong obscuration. Strictly speaking, the suppressed _L_ X,obs might also be explained by intrinsic X-ray weakness, but we argue that this is not a preferred explanation. As shown in Figure 1, there is no ambiguity that both general DOGs and 4/7 of our sources are not significantly intrinsically X-ray weak. Regarding the three remaining sources (J1042+2451, J1210+6105, and J1513+1451), their _L_ X,obs values are over two dex below the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation. Even if our highλEdd DOGs can be argued to be different from general DOGs but instead more like Hot DOGs, such a large weakness, if intrinsic, is still not expected by making an analogy to Hot DOGs. Hot DOGs present at most moderate intrinsic X-ray weakness in previous works. F. Vito et al. (2018) found that, on average, Hot DOGs may be slightly systematically below the _L_ X − _L_ 6 µm relation by 0.2 dex, while C. Ricci et al. (2017a) showed a somewhat larger suppression of 0.5 dex.[6] These differences are far from being sufficient to explain the suppressed _L_ X,obs by > 2 dex for J1042+2451, J1210+6105, and J1513+1451. Therefore, we will pirmarily focus on the heavy-obscuration explanation in the following text. \nIt is important to highlight that all of our sources, regardless of detection status, are unlikely to be solely attributed to starburst activity in the absence of AGN emission, and the AGN signatures exist in both the optical and mid-IR bands. As shown in Y. Toba et al. (2017), these sources have broad Mg ii lines and have high [O iii]/Hβ ratios (e.g., see Figure 12 in Y. Toba et al. 2017) that are characteristics of AGNs. Besides, the mid-IR colors of our sources from the WISE bands, _W_ 1 − _W_ 2, are all above 1.4 mag in the Vega system. Such red colors are above the AGN mid-IR color selection criterion, _W_ 1 − _W_ 2 ≥ 0.8, in D. Stern et al. (2012) and are expected"
