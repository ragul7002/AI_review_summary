  "abstract": "In a series of papers based on analogies with statistical physics models, we have proposed that most ﬁnancial\ncrashes are the climax of so-called log-periodic power law signatures (LPPS) associated with speculative bub-\nbles [Sornette and Johansen, 1998, Johansen and Sornette, 1999, Johansen et al., 1999, Johansen et al., 1999,\nSornette and Johansen, 2001]. In addition, a large body of empirical evidence supporting this proposition have\nbeen presented [Sornette et al., 1996, Sornette and Johansen, 1998, Johansen et al., 1999, Johansen and Sornette, 2000,\nJohansen and Sornette, 2001b, Sornette and Johansen, 2001]. Along a complementary line of research, we have\nestablished that, while the vast majority of drawdowns occurring on the major ﬁnancial markets have a dis-\ntribution which is well-described by a stretched exponential, the largest drawdowns are occurring with a sig-\nniﬁcantly larger rate than predicted by extrapolating the bulk of the distribution and should thus be con-\nsidered as outliers [Johansen and Sornette, 1998, Sornette and Johansen, 2001, Johansen and Sornette, 2001b,\nJohansen, 2002]. Here, these two lines of research are merged in a systematic way to oﬀer a classiﬁcation of\ncrashes as either events of an endogenous origin associated with preceding speculative bubbles or as events of\nan exogenous origin associated with the markets response to external shocks.\nWe ﬁrst perform an extended analysis of the distribution of drawdowns in the two leading exchange markets\n(US dollar against the Deutsmark and against the Yen), in the major world stock markets, in the U.S. and\nJapanese bond market and in the gold market, by introducing the concept of “coarse-grained drawdowns,”\nwhich allows for a certain degree of fuzziness in the deﬁnition of cumulative losses and improves on the statistics\nof our previous results.",
  "introduction": "The characterization of large stock market moves, and especially large negative price drops, is of profound\nimportance for risk management and portfolio allocation. According to standard economic theory, the complex\ntrajectory of stock market prices is the faithful reﬂection of the continuous ﬂow of news that are interpreted and\ndigested by an army of analysts and traders [Cutler et al. (1989)]. Accordingly, large market losses should result\nfrom really bad surprises. It is indeed a fact that exogenous shocks exist, as epitomized by the recent events of\nSept.",

  "methodology": "aimed at detecting anomalous events\nseen as outliers and LPPS qualifying endogenous speculative bubbles, respectively, we provide a new objective\ntest of the hypothesis that the largest negative markets moves are special and form two distinct populations.\nOn the one hand, we identify exogenous crashes which can be attributed to extraordinary important external\nperturbations in the form of news impacting the market. On the other hand, most of the crashes are found\nto be endogenous and can be seen as the natural deaths of self-organized self-reinforcing speculative bubbles\ngiving rise to speciﬁc precursory signatures, speciﬁcally LPPS. For this, we generalize our previous analysis of\ndrawdowns to drawdowns coarse-grained in amplitude (ǫ-drawdowns). Another generalization of drawdowns\ncoarse-grained in time (τ-drawdowns) will be reported elsewhere. In relation with our previous works, we ﬁnd\nthat all of the crashes (except the one in 1937) and associated bubbles previously analysed for the presence of\nLPPS are here causally linked with a drawdown outlier.",
  "results": ". Then, for each identiﬁed outlier, we check whether LPPS are present and take the\nexistence of LPPS as the qualifying signature for an endogenous crash: this is because a drawdown outlier\nis seen as the end of a speculative unsustainable accelerating bubble generated endogenously. In the absence\nof LPPS, we are able to identify what seems to have been the relevant historical event, i.e., a new piece of\ninformation of such magnitude and impact that it is seems reasonable to attribute the crash to it, in agreement\nwith the standard view of the eﬃcient market hypothesis. Such drawdown outliers are classiﬁed as having an\nexogenous origin. Globally over all the markets analyzed, we identify 49 outliers, of which 25 are classiﬁed\nas endogenous, 22 as exogeneous and 2 as associated with the Japanese anti-bubble.",
  "discussion": ". However, for a few cases the two best ﬁts are\nincluded in the statistics which explains the presence of the “second harmonics” around ω ≈11.5.\nThe consideration of the complex exponent z + iω in ﬁgure 7 comes from the fact that the third term\nC (tc −t)z cos (ω ln (tc −t) −φ) inequation (1) is nothing but the real part of the power law C′ (tc −t)z+ıω\nwhere C′ = Ce−iφ, written with the complex exponent z + iω. Thus, the log-periodic formula (1) can be viewed\nsimply as the generalization to the ﬁeld of complex numbers of standard power laws [Sornette, 1998].\nSuch a narrow range of variation of a scaling index such as ω or z+iω is in the physical sciences often attributed\nto a universal behavior reﬂecting a robust feature of the underlying mechanism of cooperative behavior between\n“units” leading to the observed critical pattern [Fisher, 1998]. We thus take the qualiﬁcation of this pattern\nencoded in the mathematical formula (1) as the deﬁnition of an endogenous bubble ending in a drawdown\noutlier or “crash.” Reciprocally, the absence of such a pattern is taken as indicating that the shock was not the\nculmination of an endogenous speculative process and may have resulted from an exogenous source.\nHere, we combine the search for log-periodic power law signatures (LPPS) embodied by eq. (1) with the\noutlier concept described below (which amounts to ﬁnd signiﬁcant deviations from eq.",
  "conclusion": "that LPPS, which are by construction transient structures, are almost uniquely associated with\na speculative phase announcing a strong change of regime.\n\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we describe in detail using four concrete examples\nwhat we mean by exogenous and endogenous crashes and bubbles with LPPS. In section 3, we discuss how our\ndrawdowns (drawups) are deﬁned and explain the methodology of our analysis. Section 3.1 presents an analysis\nof the distribution of deviations of DJIA from a 4-year smoothed average obtained by using the Daubechies\nwavelet transform, which conﬁrms independently the existence of anomalous large events in the tail of the\ndistribution. In sections 4, 5, 6 and 7, we present our results on the FX market, major stock markets, the U.S.\nand Japanese bond market and the gold market, respectively.",
