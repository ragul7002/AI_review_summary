  "abstract": "Politicization is a social phenomenon studied by political sci-\nence characterized by the extent to which ideas and facts are\ngiven a political tone. A range of topics, such as climate\nchange, religion and vaccines has been subject to increas-\ning politicization in the media and social media platforms.\nIn this work, we propose a computational method for as-\nsessing politicization in online conversations based on topic\nshifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in on-\nline conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a\nnon-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politi-\ncization – making something political, and that the more peo-\nple switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive\npolitics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fun-\ndamental challenge that must be addressed when one stud-\nies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic\nmay be politicized.",

  "results": "To assess the capacity of PU Learning in distinguishing po-\nlitical from non-political content, we manually annotated\n1,500 news posts and an equal number of comments4. Three\nof the authors independently assigned labels, and we con-\nducted a majority vote. The annotators identified explicit\nor implicit mentions of political candidates, parties, affili-\nated public offices, and notable political groups and support-\ners. Discussions related to specific legislative actions, state\npolicies, calls for political engagement, as well as political\nprotests were also categorized as political content.",
  "conclusion": "s and future research directions.\nRelated Work\nPoliticization affects how individuals allow their motivations\nand emotions to influence how they interpret new informa-\ntion (Taber, Cann, and Kucsova 2009), and political science\nhas deeply studied politicization through online social media\ndata. Observational studies usually focus on a single non-\npolitical topic, which can be as specific as the adoption of\na low-carb diet in Sweden (Holmberg 2015), a Star Wars\nmovie (Bay 2018), or a mega sports event such as the World\nCup (Meier et al. 2021); typical conclusions are that those\ntopics have been subject to increasing politicization.\nOne can see if a non-political topic is made political by\ncorrelating it with polarization (Weber, Garimella, and Borra\n2013; Brummette et al. 2018; Peterson and Mu˜noz 2022): if\ndistinct political groups refer to a non-political topic differ-\nently or at different rates, it is a strong signal of a politi-\ncized topic, such as “gun violence” and “religious free-\ndom” receiving different attention from Democrats and Re-\npublicans (Kane and Luo 2018)."
