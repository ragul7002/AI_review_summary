  "introduction": "Since the Sun can be observed both as if it was a distant a star and with sufficient spatial resolution allowing to map the solar surface to a high degree of detail, a direct comparison of two types of observations can be useful for interpreting stellar spectra. In particular, one can envision developing an approach to derive the fraction of the stellar surface occupied by a feature of a specific type (e.g., starspots, plages, network elements etc). Skumanich et al. (1984) developed a three-components model representing the contributions from the interior of supergranular cells, network boundaries, and plage to match the spectral line profile of Ca II K 393.37 nm observed at the minimum of the solar activity cycle. The model, however, was not successful in representing the disk-integrated line profiles during the rising phase of the solar cycle. Based on the model spectra derived from 3D MHD modelling of solar convection, Uitenbroek & Criscuoli (2011) concluded that simple one-dimensional models may not represent the average properties of stellar atmospheres even if they reproduce the mean observed spectra. They identified several possible reasons for this failure: nonlinearities (with temperature and/or density) in the Planck function and in molecular formation, as well as the anisotropy of convective motions. The latter strongly affects the center-to-limb variation of line-core intensities. Despite these limitations, comparision of disk-integrated and disk-resolved spectra may still be useful in answering simpler questions, such as the fraction of the stellar surface occupied by features of a specific class, which is the subject of the current study. \n1 \n2 \n_Pevtsov el al._ \n**==> picture [345 x 172] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 1.: _SOLIS facility on Kitt Peak.

Dispersion is in the vertical direction, and spatial direction is horizontal (solar East limb is to the left and West limb is to the right). Spectra corresponding to four Stokes components are shown: I – non-polarized light, V is circularly polarized light, and Q and U correspond to linearly polarized light. The two broader horizontal lines in Stokes I correspond to the photospheric iron spectral lines, and the two narrower lines are the telluric lines of molecular oxygen. The black and white pattern in Stokes V delineates the presence of longitudinal magnetic field at each pixel along the spectrograph slit._ \n## **2. Observations** \nWe employ observations from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) facility (Keller et al., 2003; Balasubramaniam & Pevtsov, 2011), which has been in operation since 2003 at the NSO facilities on Kitt Peak, Ari- \n_Disk-integrated and disk-resolved spectra from the Sun_ 3 \nzona. SOLIS (Figure 1) is composed of a single equatorial mount carrying three instruments: the 50 cm Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM), the 14 cm Full-Disk Patrol (FDP, a full disk tunable filter-based imager), and the 8 mm Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS). \nVSM uses a long (curved) slit to scan the solar image in declination, thus constructing a map of the solar surface 2048 _×_ 2048 pixels in size, with 1 pixel corresponding to about 1.14 _×_ 1.14 arcseconds. For each position along the spectrograph slit, VSM records full line profiles in Fe I 630.15-630.25 nm (photosphere, Stokes I, Q, U, and V), Ca II 854.21 nm (chromosphere, Stokes I and V), and He I 1083.0 nm (upper chromosphere, Stokes I only). It takes about 20/40 minutes to construct full disk image of the Sun in the photospheric/chromospheric spectral lines. Figure 2 shows an example of spectra of the photospheric spectral lines taken with VSM. ISS is a high spectral resolution (R _≈_ 300,000) Sun-asa-star instrument designed to observe in a broad range of wavelengths 350 nm - 1100 nm. The single-lens optical system creates a 400 _µ_ m diameter image of the Sun on the face of a 600 _µ_ m fiber, which is fed to a 2-meter Czerny-Turner double-pass spectrograph in a temperature controlled room. The spectral range is selected using a prism pre-disperser as a pre-filter. Under the current synoptic program, ISS takes observations in nine wavelength bands including Ca II 854.21 nm. The spectral sampling of the VSM/ISS in this spectral band is 3.57 pm/1.58 pm (see Figure 3). Additional information about these instruments and the corresponding data reduction can be found elsewhere (e.g., Bertello et al., 2011; Pietarila et al., 2013; Pevtsov et al., 2014). Here, we use ISS and VSM observations taken on the same day to explore the possibility of reconstructing the disk-integrated (Sun-as-a-star) profile of the Ca II 854.21 nm spectral line by combining disk-resolved spectra. \n## **3. Reconstructing Disk-Integrated Spectra from Disk-Resolved Spectra** \nDisk-integrated spectra can be derived as a sum of disk-resolved spectra for each contributing pixel on the solar disk using \n**==> picture [299 x 28] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere the disk-resolved spectra _Ii_ ( _ϕ, CMD, λ_ ) at each latitude ( _ϕ_ ) and longitude (central meridian distance, CMD) are weighted by a limb darkening function, _f_ ( _ϕ, CMD_ ), and their central wavelength ( _λ_ 0) is Doppler-shifted (e.g., solar rotation) \n**==> picture [300 x 12] intentionally omitted <==**\nHere, subscript _i_ indicates that the profiles in each pixel may have a different shape depending on the type of feature in that location (e.g., sunspot, plage etc). In addition, VSM profiles need to be corrected for a scattered light contribution. We consider ISS profiles to be largely free of scattered light because of the double-pass spectrograph design. The contribution of scattered light to VSM spectra was estimated from the observations of the Venus transit on 6 June 2012. The amount of stray light present was determined _a priori_ by comparing \n4 \n_Pevtsov el al._ \n**==> picture [231 x 327] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 3.: _Example of Ca_ II _854.21 nm spectral line profiles from ISS (Sun-as-a-star, bottom) and VSM (top). Thick dashed lines mark the approximate spectral range observed by VSM. Examples of VSM spectra corresponding to different features are shown by different colors; from top to bottom: plage (red), large sunspot (black), quiet Sun at solar disk center (green), and quiet Sun at about 20 degrees of heliocentric distance (blue). For comparision, we scaled all profiles by mean intensity near the telluric line (pixels 20 – 25)._ \nthe apparent intensity of the central region of the transiting Venusian disk to an annular average of quiet Sun pixels outside the Venusian disk. There was a strong spectral variation to the amount of stray light; about 8% in the wings, increasing non-linearly to about 13% in the core. For the analysis presented in this article, we used 10% contribution from scattered light, independent of wavelength. \nTo reconstruct disk-integrated spectra from disk-resolved spectra we follow three steps as described below. \n3.1 Step 1: Integration of Observed Profiles \nFor the first step, we simply integrate all disk-resolved profiles from the VSM. As the intensity in these profiles already reflects the limb darkening, and their wavelength position corresponds to the velocity field on the Sun, these corrections are not needed at this step. Figure 4 shows that a simple summation of disk- \n_Disk-integrated and disk-resolved spectra from the Sun_ \n5 \n**==> picture [154 x 154] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [231 x 184] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 4.: _Example of an intensity image derived from the wing of the Ca_ II _854.21 nm spectral line observed by VSM (left), and a comparison of disk-integrated (ISS, red) and sum of disk-resolved (black) profiles for same day observations. For reference, line profile observed at solar disk center is also shown (blue line)._ \nresolved spectra (corrected for the contribution from scattered light) fits the Sunas-a-star (disk-integrated) spectra quite well. One can note that in the profile computed by summation of disk-resolved profiles (black line) the intensity in the wings is slightly higher than in the sun-as-a-star profile (red line). We believe that this difference cannot be explained by the difference in spectral resolution between VSM and ISS because observed (VSM) profile at disk center does not show such disagreement with the ISS profile. This will be further investigated as we continue this study. \n## 3.2 Step 2: Building a Model",

For this step we used the AutoClass classification code (Cheeseman & Stutz, 1996) and followed the approach described in Ulrich et al. (2010). In short: \n1. We classify each pixel in a “training” set of images by its class. In general, the number of classes can be determined by the code or fixed by the user. For this exercise we limited the number of classes to just two: “Quiet Sun” and “Plage”. \n2. We establish a model relationship between disk-integrated and disk-resolved parameters. For the particular case of the line core intensity _Ic_ ( _t_ ) and for each image taken at time _t_ , we have: \n**==> picture [235 x 34] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere _J_ is the number of classes ( _J_ = 2 in our case), _Aj_ ( _t_ ) is the expected fractional area of the solar disk covered by class _j_ at the time _t_ , and _cj_ is a coefficient that corresponds to the _Ic_ ( _t_ ) value the Sun would produce were it covered entirely by a surface of class _j_ . \n3. We apply the model to new data. \nAs a training set, we employed model data (see Figure 5) derived from VSM observations taken on 1 July 2014. We further modified the model data set by varying the area of the solar disk covered by plage. Figure 6 shows the change in core intensity of the model Ca II 854.21 nm spectral line computed as in Step 2 as a function of the fraction of the solar disk covered by plage. \n_Disk-integrated and disk-resolved spectra from the Sun_ \n7 \n**==> picture [269 x 215] intentionally omitted <==**\nFigure 6.: _Change in core intensity (percentage relative to plage-free solar disk) as a function of area of the solar disk covered by plage, derived from model spectral cubes computed in Step 2._ \n_Acknowledgements._ This work utilizes SOLIS data obtained by the NSO Integrated Synoptic Program (NISP), managed by the National Solar Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. \n## **References** \nBalasubramaniam, K.
