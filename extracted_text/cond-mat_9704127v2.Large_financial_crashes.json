We generalize our previous work [34] and\nshow how the ﬁrst generic nonlinear correction to the renormalization group equation\npreviously proposed accounts quantitatively for the behavior of the Dow Jones and\nS&P500 (Standard and Poor) indices up to 8 years prior to the crashes of 1929 and\n1987.

  "discussion": "To validate the proposed model requires that one obtains a good ﬁt in several data\nsets with approximately the same parameter values. Stated somewhat pointedly: one\ngood ﬁt make a data description; two good ﬁts make a system description. In both\ncases, the ﬁt has an overall error of less then 10 percent over a time interval extending\nup to 8 years before the crashes. There are presumably other sorts of ﬁts that would\nwork, although the fact that 8 years of data can be adjusted with an error of less then\n10 percent using only 5 parameters (not counting the arbitrary time unit φ) is rather\nremarkable. It is surely irrational to infer the validity of a description based on a\nsingle ﬁt.",
  "conclusion": "is that the qualitative observation of [35] of the log-frequency\nshift is rationalized by the nonlinear correction.\nModel and nonlinear generalization\nUsing the renormalization group (RG) formalism on the stock market index I amounts\nto assuming that the index at a given time t is related to that at another time t′ by\nthe transformations [34]\nx′ = φ(x),\n(1)\nF(x) = g(x) + 1\nµF\n\u0012\nφ(x)\n\u0013\n,\n(2)\nwhere x = tc −t. tc is the time of global crash and φ is called the RG ﬂow map. Here,\nF(x) = I(tc) −I(t)\nsuch that F = 0 at the critical point and µ is a constant describing the scaling of\nthe index evolution upon a rescaling of time (1). The function g(x) represents the\nnon-singular part of the function F(x). We assume as usual [36] that the function\nF(x) is continuous and that φ(x) is diﬀerentiable.\nAs the simplest non-trivial solution beyond the pure power law solution to (2),\nwe have proposed [34]\nI (t) = A + B (tc −t)α [1 + C cos (ω log (tc −t) −φ)] .\n(3)\nIt includes the ﬁrst Fourier component of a general log-periodic correction to a pure\npower law behavior of an observable (here, the stock market index) exhibiting a\nsingular behavior at the time tc of the crash, i.e., which becomes scale-invariant at\nthe critical point tc.",
