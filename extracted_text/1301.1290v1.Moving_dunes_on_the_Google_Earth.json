  "methodology": "exist for surveying the dunes and estimate their migration rate. Among methods \nsuitable for the macroscopic scale, the use of the satellite images available on Google Earth is a \nconvenient resource, in particular because of its time series. Some examples of the use of this \nfeature of Google Earth are here proposed. \n \nKeywords: Dunes, Dune Migration, Satellite Imagery, Google Earth, Image Processing \n \nIn several regions of the world, the motion of sand dunes, though it seems quite slow, can become a \nchallenge or even a threat for human activities. Some engineering solutions are available for \nprotecting the sites, such as methods for surveying the dune fields and estimate their migration rate.",
  "results": "were implemented in sandy lands  \nto evaluate the effects of different methods for stabilizing sand dune by means of vegetation \nrestoration [2], creating an environment suitable for it [3]. However, in hyper-arid area, these \nmethods are rather challenging [4]. \nSand dunes are hills of sand with different forms and sizes, which can move. As complex systems \nof particles, the dunes and their motion have attracted several experimental studies in the past [5,6] \nand recently [7], such as many numerical simulations [8-12]. Let us remember that the first \nsystematic study of the motion of dunes was due to Ralph Bagnold, who during 1940s did \nmeasurements directly on natural dunes, but also experiments in wind tunnels [13].",
  "discussion": "on how some data can obtained from the time series of \nGoogle Earth. It is clear that the speed of the dunes can be easily measured. Moreover, we can find \nseveral examples of the interaction of dunes. In particular the field of the dunes of Figure 10 and 11 \nis under investigation to find other examples of collisions. \n \n\n \n8",
