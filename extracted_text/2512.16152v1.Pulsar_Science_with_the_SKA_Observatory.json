  "abstract": "The large instantaneous sensitivity, a wide frequency coverage and flexible observation modes with\nlarge number of beams in the sky are the main features of the SKA observatory’s two telescopes,\nthe SKA-Low and the SKA-Mid, which are located on two different continents.\nOwing to these\ncapabilities, the SKAO telescopes are going to be a game-changer for radio astronomy in general\nand pulsar astronomy in particular. The eleven articles in this special issue on pulsar science with\nthe SKA Observatory describe its impact on different areas of pulsar science. In this lead article, a\nbrief description of the two telescopes highlighting the relevant features for pulsar science is presented\nfollowed by an overview of each accompanying article, exploring the inter-relationship between different\npulsar science use cases.\n1.",

Galactic Plasma Studies (Tiburzi et al.)\nPulsars have long served as precise probes of the\nGalaxy’s ionized plasma.\nObservations with LOFAR,\nGMRT, and MeerKAT have traced electron-density fluc-\ntuations and revealed turbulence consistent with a Kol-\nmogorov spectrum, while long-term DM monitoring has\nexposed changes due to solar wind and interstellar struc-\ntures. Yet, these measurements are limited in frequency\ncoverage and spatial sampling.\nThe SKA-Low AA* array will achieve unmatched\nprecision in dispersion and scattering studies, tracking\nDM variations across hundreds of channels and enabling\ndetailed mapping of the turbulent interstellar medium.\nIn parallel, the SKA-Mid AA* will provide high-\nfrequency coverage to separate frequency-dependent dis-\npersion from refraction, allowing a full multi-scale char-\nacterization of Galactic plasma and solar-wind dynamics.\nOnce AA4 arrays are in place, the SKA-Low will\ndeliver a high-resolution 3D model of Galactic electron\ndensity, while the SKA-Mid will furnish ultra-stable\ntiming data critical to Pulsar Timing Arrays. Together,\nthey will refine models of plasma turbulence, correct for\nISM effects in gravitational-wave searches, and provide\nthe most comprehensive view to date of the Milky Way’s\nmagneto-ionic medium (Tiburzi et al. 2025).\n\n6\n3.7.",
