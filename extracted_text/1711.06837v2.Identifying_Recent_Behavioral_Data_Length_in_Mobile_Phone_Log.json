  "abstract": "Mobile phone log data (e.g., phone call log) is not static as it is progressively added to day-by-day according to individual’s diverse behaviors with mobile phones. Since human behavior changes over time, the most _recent pattern_ is more interesting and significant than older ones for predicting individual’s behavior. The goal of this poster paper is to identify the recent behavioral _data length_ dynamically from the entire phone log for recency-based behavior modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first _dynamic_ recent log-based study that takes into account individual’s _recent behavioral patterns_ for modeling their phone call behaviors.",
  "introduction": "Nowadays, mobile phones have become part of our life. Mobile phones can record various types of contextual data related to a user’s phone call activities. In the real life, individual mobile phone users may behave differently (Accept _|_ Reject _|_ Missed _|_ Outgoing) in different contexts such as time-of-the-day, days-of-the-week, social situations (e.g., meeting), locations, social relationships (e.g., mother) between individuals [3]. Modeling an individual’s phone call behavior utilizing _recent log data_ may assist them in their daily activities through capabilities, such as call interruption management, call firewall, call reminder systems. \nSince human behavior changes over time, the most _recent pattern_ is more interesting and significant than older ones for predicting individual’s phone call behavior. To model users’ present behavior, a number of research [5, 6] have used the \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

However, such arbitrary _static_ data length is not meaningful to predict future phone call behavior as the time frame of the data length depends on when in the recent past behavior of a user has been changed significantly. Assume that as per log data the user has a call ‘reject’ behavioral pattern on Monday[10:00AM-12:00PM] as she used to have a regular meeting at that time. Currently, she has no meeting at that time period on Monday and she typically ‘accepts’ incoming phone calls. So, for this example, the past ‘reject’ behavioral pattern, even with high evidence according to log data, is not appropriate to predict her future behavior. Therefore, _identifying the optimal length_ of log data that encompasses _recent behavioral patterns_ is the key for modeling individual’s recency-based behavior. \nTo identify such data length, if we consider only a short length (e.g., last week’s data) as indicative of recent behavior, there may not be enough data instances in that time period to infer a valid rule for predicting future phone call behavior. Creating rules based on observations with so little “support”is unlikely to be effective [4]. On the other hand, if we take into account comparatively longer lengths (e.g., last 6 months data) as indicative of recent behavior, we could get greater _support_ but it might result a greater _behavioral variations_ thus decrease the confidence of some expected rules. As a consequence, we may miss these rules because of low confidence. Therefore, the _optimal length_ of log data that reflects the recent behavior of an individual needs to be identified for recency-based behavioral modeling.",
  "conclusion": "In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to identify recent behavioral data length in mobile phone log dynamically by analyzing individual’s behavioral patterns. Although we choose the phone call behavior as an example, our approach is also applicable to other application domains. We believe that our concept of dynamic recent log data helps both the researchers and application developers for predicting behavior of end mobile phone users according to their needs in various real-world applications, such as intelligent call interruption handling, mobile notification management systems, mobile application recommender systems etc."
