  "abstract": ". This paper aims to apply network analysis to all players who have par-\nticipated in the Indian Pro Kabaddi League since its inception. The Kabaddi net-\nwork has been constructed based on the number of teams and players they have \nplayed with. The players have been ranked with the help of the degree and Pag-\neRank algorithm. Small-world phenomenon is observed in the Kabaddi network.",
  "introduction": "Social networks have become a fundamental paradigm for understanding the complex-\nities of human interactions and relationships in various contexts [1, 2, 3]. With the ad-\nvent of digital technologies and the proliferation of online platforms, studying social \nnetworks has gained significant attention across disciplines such as sociology, commu-\nnication, and computer science [4, 5]. \n  \nAt its core, a social network comprises individuals or entities (nodes) interconnected \nby relationships or interactions (edges), forming a complex web of connections. These \nconnections can manifest in diverse forms, including friendship network [6], coauthor-\nship network [7], movie actor network [3], and communication network [8], sports net-\nwork [9]. \n  \nNetwork science tools have been applied in different sports to analyze the structure of \nthe network.",

  "results": "relevant to user queries. The web pages are considered as nodes and the corre-\nsponding hyperlinks which lead to that particular page are considered as edges. The \nPageRank for an undirected network is defined as [4]: \n    \n𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝑢𝑖) =\n1−𝑐\n𝑁+ 𝑐∑\n𝐴𝑖𝑗\n𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝑢𝑗)\n𝑘𝑗\n𝑁\n𝑗=1\n            (4) \nHere, c is the damping factor/jump factor. Typically, the value of c is set to 0.85. \nRank (ui) and Rank (uj) are the PageRank scores of the vertices i and j, respectively.",

  "conclusion": "In this paper, we have constructed the Kabaddi network based on the participation \nof players in the Pro Kabaddi League. We have examined the Kabaddi network as a \nsimple graph, with players as nodes, and an edge connecting two nodes if those players \n\n9 \nhave been on the same team. Our analysis reveals that the graph has 863 nodes and \n17195 edges. It has been observed that the Kabaddi network is highly clustered with \nthe clustering coefficient of 0.7280 and the average shortest path length l which comes \nout to be 2.349. Consequently, the network possesses small-world properties.",
