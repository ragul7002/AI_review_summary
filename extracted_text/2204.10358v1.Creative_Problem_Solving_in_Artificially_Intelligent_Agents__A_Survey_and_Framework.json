The\nplanner itself serves two functions: 1) it synthesizes a robot controller for achieving the task,\nand 2) it executes the controller. In contrast to navigational tasks, Boteanu et al. (Boteanu,\nKent, Mohseni-Kabir, Rich, & Chernova, 2015), focus on using Hierarchical Task Networks\n(HTNs) for CPS by incorporating novel uses of objects within the planner, e.g., using a\nbowl instead of a basket. Prior work has also focused on discovery of new actions in the\ncontext of planning. Suarez-Hernandez et al. (Suárez-Hernández, Segovia-Aguas, Torras,\n& Alenyà, 2020) introduce a novel approach for the unsupervised synthesis of new action\n12\n\nCreative Problem Solving in Intelligent Agents: A Framework and Survey\nprimitives. Gizzi et al. (Gizzi, Castro, & Sinapov, 2019; Gizzi, Hassan, Lin, Rhea, & Sinapov,\n2021) discover novel actions through action segmentation and behavior babbling, respectively,\nwhich they use as a method for knowledge expansion. In this way, the agent can then re-plan\ntoward a goal in a novel scenario with the new knowledge. In similar work, Sarathy et al.\n(Sarathy, Kasenberg, Goel, Sinapov, & Scheutz, 2020), discover action operators through RL\nas a way to expand the knowledge base for CPS through re-planning.\nMotion Planning\nWhile the approaches described above focus on task planning, several CPS approaches have\nalso been introduced for creative motion planning. Fitzgerald et al. (Fitzgerald, Goel, &\nThomaz, 2017, 2014) focus on the transfer of skills (i.e., motion trajectories) from a source\nobject to a target object. For example, their work introduces approaches for adapting motion\ntrajectories for novel uses, such as adapting trajectory for a ladle with a short handle to one\nthat has a much longer handle. In similar work, Gajewski et al. (Gajewski, Ferreira, Bartels,\nWang, Guerin, Indurkhya, Beetz, & Śniezyński, 2019) focus on adapting trajectories from a\nsource object to a target object by reasoning about the geometric similarities between the\nsource and target objects. Their work diﬀers from that of Fitzgerald et al. in terms of the\nunderlying representations used. In contrast to trajectory adaptation, Qin et al. (Qin, Fang,\nZhu, Fei-Fei, & Savarese, 2020) introduce an approach for enabling robots to manipulate\nnovel objects as tools for diﬀerent manipulation tasks. Here, the robot reasons about tool use\nbased on the underlying object representations, as opposed to adapting a known trajectory\nfrom a source to a target object. In contrast to tool manipulation, Murooka et al. (Murooka,\nOkada, & Inaba, 2019) focus on incorporating the dynamics of screws and screwdrivers\ninto motion planning, in order to enable a robot to self-tighten loose screws on its body to\naugment its physical capabilities.\nSome CPS approaches leverage high-level task constraints for low-level motion planning.\nFor example, Toussaint et al. (Toussaint et al., 2018) introduce a novel approach for “Task\nand Motion Planning” (TAMP) to address the problem of sequential manipulation for tool\nuse. They impose explicit task constraints on actions (in a continuous space) regarding\nthe physical dynamics of objects, and optimize over the constraints using motion planning.\nSimilarly, Silver et al. (Silver, Chitnis, Tenenbaum, Kaelbling, & Lozano-Pérez, 2021) show\nhow bottom up relational learning can support learning new probabilistic operators in a\nTAMP paradigm. Low-level transitions are converted into high level state representations\nof lifted eﬀects (predicates with argument placeholders), which are then processed via\ngreedy/best-ﬁrst search to discover new preconditions. Hence, all of the approaches described\nin this section enable robots to adapt to novel and unforeseen task environments through\nplanning.\n4.1.2 Learning\nWithin the CPS literature, learning is used in two ways: a) to learn a solution or policy for\naccomplishing a task goal (i.e., through reinforcement learning), and b) to learn representa-\ntions that can then be combined with planning or reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. In\nthis section, we focus on the former since it relates speciﬁcally to the problem formulation.

  "methodology": "for solving oﬀ-nominal, or anomalous problems in autonomous systems.\nDespite many advancements in planning and learning, resolving novel problems or adapting\nexisting knowledge to a new context, especially in cases where the environment may\nchange in unpredictable ways post deployment, remains a limiting factor in the safe and\nuseful integration of intelligent systems. The emergence of increasingly autonomous systems\ndictates the necessity for AI agents to deal with environmental uncertainty through creativity.\nTo stimulate further research in CPS, we present a deﬁnition and a framework of CPS,\nwhich we adopt to categorize existing AI methods in this ﬁeld. Our framework consists of\nfour main components of a CPS problem, namely, 1) problem formulation, 2) knowledge\nrepresentation, 3) method of knowledge manipulation, and 4) method of evaluation. We\nconclude our survey with open research questions, and suggested directions for the future.\n1. Introduction\nCreativity is often described as a hallmark of sophisticated intelligence. The Oxford English\nDictionary deﬁnes “creativity” as “Inventive, imaginative; of, relating to, displaying, using,\nor involving imagination or original ideas as well as routine skill or intellect, esp.\nin\nliterature or art” (Dictionary, 1989). Despite our familiarity with the notion of creativity,\nunderstanding and implementing creativity in artiﬁcially intelligent systems continues to\nbe a challenge. Computational Creativity (CC) is an active area of research that seeks to\ndevelop computational methods that are capable of generating a creative output, reminiscent\nof the creative processes in humans. The CC research community includes a diverse body of\nresearchers, spanning the ﬁelds of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science.\n∗. Both authors contributed equally\n1\narXiv:2204.10358v1  [cs.AI]  21 Apr 2022\n\nGizzi, Nair, Sinapov & Chernova\nFigure 1: Examples of CPS in human and non-human species: The jury-rigged ﬁlter\nconstructed by the astronauts on Apollo 13 (left, image credit: NASA). Rook extracting a\nbucket by bending a piece of wire to make a hook (right) (Bird & Emery, 2009).\nThe goal of CC research, as described by the Association for Computational Creativity1, is\n“[to gain] the ability to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one\nof several ends, including the construction of a program or computer capable of human-level\ncreativity, to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective\non creative behavior in humans, and to design programs that can enhance human creativity\nwithout necessarily being creative themselves” (ICCC, ). While there has been extensive\nwork in the area of Computational Creativity in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), these works\nare primarily focused on the generation of creative artifacts, e.g., paintings, poems etc.\nIn contrast, there is very limited focus on creativity that is speciﬁcally task-oriented, i.e.,\ncreativity in problem solving.\nCreative problem solving (CPS) focuses on using creative processes in the context of\nproblem solving. Both human and non-human species have been shown to creatively solve\nproblems (Boesch & Boesch, 1990; Baker, Kanitscheider, Markov, Wu, Powell, McGrew, &\nMordatch, 2019) (Figure 1), e.g., crows have been shown to spontaneously modify tools by\nshaping hooks out of wire, and using the modiﬁed tools in the correct sequence of actions\nrequired to retrieve food (Bird & Emery, 2009). Various models of CPS in humans have\nalso been proposed by researchers over the years (Isaksen & Treﬃnger, 2004), beginning as\nearly as 1952 with the work of Alex Osborn, who presented a comprehensive description\nof a seven-stage CPS process (Osborn, 1952). Prior work by Mumford et al. (Mumford,\nMobley, Reiter-Palmon, Uhlman, & Doares, 1991; Mumford, Supinski, Baughman, Costanza,\n& Threlfall, 1997) has also investigated CPS processes in humans by conducting human\nparticipant studies and evaluations. They deﬁne creative problems as problems that arise in\nill-deﬁned situations, thus eliciting creativity in humans. Further, their work highlights core\ncognitive processes involved in CPS, including problem construction, information encoding,\nidea evaluation, implementation, and monitoring. While these works primarily explore CPS\nin humans and other animals, there is very limited work focusing on CPS in artiﬁcial agents.\nWhat makes CPS important for AI? Numerous real-world examples demonstrate\nthe practical importance of CPS, particularly when dealing with crises or time-constrained\nscenarios. For instance, in the Apollo 13 incident of 1970, astronauts on board the spacecraft\n1. The Association of Computational Creativity is a nonproﬁt organization dedicated to the advancement of\nCC, and organizing body of the International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC)\n2\n\nCreative Problem Solving in Intelligent Agents: A Framework and Survey\ncreatively constructed a makeshift CO2 ﬁ",
  "results": ", the robot attaches hooks to its body to\nenable it to carry grocery bags. Prior work by Hangl et al. (Hangl et al., 2017) parameterize\nthe notions of “curiosity” and “boredom” using Shannon entropy, in order to guide the learning\nof new robot behaviors.\nLearned Representations (Non-parametric)\nRepresentation learning refers to a set of techniques for learning representations or “fea-\ntures” that are useful for encoding a given set of inputs (Bengio, Courville, & Vincent,\n2013). Here, the term “useful” is used to indicate features that are capable of diﬀerenti-\nating between classes of inputs. When applied to CPS, non-parametric representations\nof the initial conceptual space of the agent is learned through observed data. Within the\nnew representation, new concepts are discovered for solving tasks. The vast majority of\nmodels used for learning non-parametric representations in CPS include diﬀerent forms\nof neural networks, such as Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Conditional\nVariational Auto-Encoders (CVAEs), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN). In addition\nto neural networks, few approaches in CPS have also used Support Vector Machines (SVM),\nk-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Decision Trees (DTs). While we do not delve into the details\nof each machine learning algorithm, we brieﬂy describe the ML approaches used in each paper.\nSupervised Learning: Among existing CPS approaches that learn non-parametric repre-\nsentations using neural networks, Xie et al. (Xie et al., 2019) use LSTMs to learn skill\nrepresentations for improvisational tool use. In this case, the robot uses data collected from\nhuman demonstrations in order to train the LSTMs to represent tool use trajectories for any\n20\n\nCreative Problem Solving in Intelligent Agents: A Framework and Survey\ngiven tool, often adapting the trajectory to demonstrate improvisational skills. Similar work\nby Qin et al. (Qin et al., 2020) use the PointNet architecture (Qi, Su, Mo, & Guibas, 2017)\nfor learning keypoint (i.e., points of interest) representations of tools. The network predicts\nnovel keypoints, given an input tool, e.g., Grasping locations for unconventional uses of the\ntool. Baker et al. (Baker et al., 2019) use LSTMs within their policy network architecture\nto enable a set of agents to learn creative policies that involve using objects to succeed in\na game of hide-and-seek. Within the space of tool construction, prior work by Nair et al.\n(Nair et al., 2019, 2019; Shrivatsav et al., 2019) have used FNNs and DNNs to perform\ntool substitution and tool construction. These networks are used to represent objects in\nterms of their shape and material, in order to identify appropriate objects for constructing\nor substituting a missing tool. In closely related work, Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2020) use\nGated Graph Neural Networks (GGNNs) to represent object shapes and reason about pairs\nof objects for tool construction. Bapst et al. (Bapst et al., 2019) combine two types of\ninternal representations, namely, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) for the construction of physical structures in simulation. Prior\nwork in tool substitution by Schoeler et al. (Schoeler & Wörgötter, 2015) uses SVMs to\npredict alternate uses for given objects. They formulate their work as a part-based aﬀordance\nlearning problem, wherein the models learn shape representations of the tools as histograms\n(called part signatures) through supervised learning. These representations are then used for\nidentifying tool substitutes.\nApart from representing tools and structures, neural networks have also been successfully\napplied to represent the agent. In these cases, the non-parametric representations model the\nagent’s physical design or morphology. Prior work by Pathak et al. (Pathak et al., 2019)\nhave used Dynamic Graph Networks (DGN) in order to enable an agent to reason about its\nmorphology. Here, the limbs and joints of the agent are represented in the form of a graph\nlearned using DGN, and combined with RL to learn motion policies consistent with the graph\nstructure. Similar work, has also used FNNs to represent agent designs, in conjunction with\nRL approaches such as REINFORCE (Ha, 2019) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n(Schaﬀet al., 2019).\nUnsupervised/Semi-Supervised Learning: Existing approaches in CPS have also used\nunsupervised/semi-supervised learning methods. Prior work by Sinapov et al. (Sinapov\n& Stoytchev, 2007, 2008) represent tools using k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Decision\nTrees (DTs). In their work, the robot gathers observations through repeated interactions\nwith various tools and the collected observations are used to cluster and learn aﬀordance\nrepresentations for new tools. In Kralik et al. (Kralik et al., 2016), external state represen-\ntations are clustered into hierarchical state representations, thus discretizing a continuous\nnon-symbolic state space for RL.

  "discussion": "of CPS, combining CC and AI principles, is vital for encouraging future work in this area.\nOur paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section 2, by discussing existing deﬁnitions\nof CPS in AI along with presenting our deﬁnition, and contrasting it to the existing work. We\nthen describe relevant aspects in CC in Section 3, and describe how they can be adapted to\nCPS. In Sections 4 and 5, we present a framework that highlights four key processes involved\nin CPS. We further classify existing research in the context of the presented framework. In\nSection 6, we discuss examples of CPS architectures in the current literature. Finally, we\nconclude our survey in Section 7 with open research questions.\n2. Deﬁning Creative Problem Solving in AI\nWe begin by presenting existing deﬁnitions of creative problem solving. Derived from the\nformulation of planning and learning problems in artiﬁcial intelligence (which we explain\nin this section), we introduce our deﬁnition for CPS, and highlight its contribution and\ndiﬀerences from existing deﬁnitions.\n3\n\nGizzi, Nair, Sinapov & Chernova\n2.1 Existing Deﬁnitions of Creative Problem Solving\nThere have been eﬀorts within the research community to formalize a general deﬁnition and\nprocess for CPS. Closely related to our work, prior research has formulated CPS based on\nclassical planning and concept re-representation.\nPrior work by Olteţeanu (Olteteanu, 2014) deﬁnes CPS from an object aﬀordance\nperspective. Aﬀordances broadly refer to action possibilities for objects, e.g., cups are\npour-able and doors are open-able (Gibson, 1977). Formally, aﬀordances are deﬁned as\nrelationships between objects, actions, and the eﬀects of applying the actions on the objects\n(Şahin, Çakmak, Doğar, Uğur, & Üçoluk, 2007). Olteţeanu (Olteteanu, 2014) distinguishes\ncreative problems from normal problem solving tasks in that CPS problems have poor\nrepresentational structure, in particular the representation of objects (initial states, relations\nbetween objects etc.). Collectively, these entities are referred to as concepts, and their\nrepresentations consist of aﬀordances, visuospatial features, or semantic tags. From this,\nOlteţeanu deﬁnes the process of CPS as “the ability of a cognitive, natural, or artiﬁcial\nsystem to use new objects to solve a problem, other than the ones that have been stored in\nits memory as tools for that speciﬁc purpose (if any), or to create those objects by putting\ntogether objects or parts of objects the system has access to. Depending on the problem, objects\ncan be either physical or abstract/informational (concepts, problem templates, heuristics or\nother forms of representations)” (Olteteanu, 2015). However, their framework speciﬁcally\nrefer to objects, and do not cover other concepts relevant to problem solving in AI, e.g.,\nactions and environment states.\nIn a contrasting deﬁnition, Sarathy and Scheutz (Sarathy & Scheutz, 2018) deﬁne the\nnotion of “MacGyver-esque” creativity as embodied agents that can “generate, execute, and\nlearn strategies for identifying and solving seemingly unsolvable real-world problems”. They\napproach CPS as a planning problem, introducing the notion of a MacGyver Problem (MGP)\nas a planning problem in the agent’s world that has a goal state that is currently unreachable\nby the agent (Sarathy & Scheutz, 2018). They formalize MGP with respect to an agent t, as\na planning problem in the agent’s world Wt, that has a goal state g currently unreachable\nby the agent. In order to solve an MGP, the agent modiﬁes its domain knowledge (through\ndomain expansion or contraction) by sensing and perceiving its environment and its own self,\nenabling the agent to discover previously unknown information needed for accomplishing the\ngoal. However, the proposed deﬁnition of MGPs do not cover learning approaches in AI for\nCPS and does not describe potential methods for modifying domain knowledge of the agent.\n2.2 Proposed Deﬁnition of Creative Problem Solving\nIn this section, we prese",
  "conclusion": "s\nThis survey discussed creative problem solving in artiﬁcial intelligence, by formally deﬁning\nCPS, and introducing a framework that encompasses existing CPS approaches. In contrast\nto existing CPS formalizations, our deﬁnition 1) introduces a broader notion of concepts,\nand 2) connects Boden’s three levels of creativity from computational creativity literature,\nto problem solving in AI, thus leveraging theoretical aspects from both CC and AI. Our\npresented CPS framework consists of four key steps including, 1) problem formulation, 2)\nknowledge representation, 3) knowledge manipulation, and 4) evaluation. Additionally,\nwe categorized existing CPS research within our framework. We further expanded on our\nCPS framework to discuss the two types of conceptual spaces that are modiﬁed, i.e., states\n(including objects, terrain and agent) and actions. We further categorized existing approaches\nalong this dimension. Next, we presented existing CPS architectures, also organizing them\nwithin our CPS taxonomy. Our survey of the literature concluded with a list of open research\nquestions, which we believe will serve as a useful guide for future work in CPS. We further\nhope that this survey will encourage research into this relatively unexplored ﬁeld, bridging\nthe gap between CC and problem solving in AI.\nAppendices\nPaper\nFormuln. Repn.\nManipn.
