  "introduction": "A popular assumption about the dark matter (DM) is that it is composed of new particles. While these particles have not been detected directly, there is an ongoing campaign to constrain their properties from various arguments. From cosmological observations DM particles must be sufficiently “cold” to cluster at galactic and larger scales; their interaction with baryons and electrons are constrained by the direct searches; their lifetime and annihilation cross section must be compatible with the measured DM abundance and must satisfy the constraints from the indirect detection experiments [1]. While many regions of the parameter space are now excluded, large areas still remain open, and new ways to constrain them are therefore worth exploring. \nIf the DM particles can annihilate into the Standard Model (SM) particles, they are typically expected to also scatter on ordinary matter. They may in this case accumulate in astrophysical objects such as stars and planets, where their annihilation may produce detectable effects thus allowing for the constraints on the DM parameters to be placed. For instance, the DM accumulation in the Sun can lead to a detectable neutrino flux [2– 5]. If astrophysical object has no internal heat sources, the heat from the DM annihilations can be detectable in some cases. The DM annihilation in neutron stars [6– 12], in white dwarfs [7, 13], in the Earth [14–16], and in Mars [17] has been previously considered in this context. \nIn this paper we examine the observational consequences of DM accumulation and annihilation in the Moon. One of such consequences is Moon heating. Like in Earth and other planets, internal heat sources of the Moon are several orders of magnitude less efficient than typical fusion reactions in stars. The source of internal heat in planetary bodies is attributed mainly to residual heat from gravitational energy left over from planetary accretion and core formation, and the decay of radiogenic isotopes [18]. However, since the Moon is geologically in- \n> _∗_ Electronic address: rgaranir@ulb.ac.be \n> _†_ Electronic address: ptinyakov@ulb.ac.be \nactive today, it is suggested that much of the Moon’s total internal heat comes from continuous radiogenic decay [19] (see Sect. II for details about the Moon composition and internal heat). This makes even a small heat produced by DM annihilations potentially detectable. Although Moon models are currently less advanced than the Earth ones, even the present-day Moon heat flow measurements translate into constraints that are competitive with those derived from the Earth, while its proximity and potential accessibility to direct measurements promise significant improvement in the future. In addition, Moon is believed to have lighter composition than Earth, so the DM capture rate (and, consequently, the constraints) which depends on the chemical composition in a resonant way is maximized at smaller DM masses, thus some complementarity with the Earth constraints is expected. \nAnother potentially observable effect that we consider is the _γ_ -ray production. In some limited range of DM masses around few tens of GeV, a sizable fraction of DM annihilations happens outside of the Moon. Such annihilations are directly observable by the _γ_ -ray telescopes. Due to observational conditions, this effect is more important for the Moon than the Earth. \nThe constrains that we obtain are competitive with those previously derived for the Earth, but are inferior to the direct detection constraints in the same range of masses. The latter, however, do not cover the region of large cross sections where the DM particles do not reach the underground detectors. Like the Earth constraints, the Moon constraints are free from this problem. \nBefore going into a detailed calculation it is instructive to make rough estimates. The rate at which the DM of mass _m_ crosses the Moon surface (the geometric capture rate) is given by _πR_ �[2] _ρ_ DM _v/m_ , where _R_ � = 1737 km is the Moon radius, while _ρ_ DM = 0 _._ 3 GeV _/_ cm[3] and _v_ = 270 km/s are the DM density and velocity, assuming the standard DM halo parameters at the Earth location in the Galaxy. If all this DM gets captured and annihilates in the Moon producing heat, the total released power would be _∼_ 100 TW. This exceeds by a factor _∼_ 200 the measured value 0 _._ 45 TW (see Sect. II for details about the Moon). Requiring that the actual capture rate is smaller by the factor 1 _/_ 200 than this geometric maximum gives constraints on the DM parameters. Like- \n2 \nwise, the _γ_ -ray flux from the Moon is measured by the Fermi-LAT satellite to be _∼_ 10 _[−]_[4] MeV/cm[2] s [20], which corresponds to the total power of _∼_ 3 _×_ 10 _[−]_[7] TW. Again, requiring that the limb of DM annihilations around Moon does not over-shine this measured value gives additional constraints on DM parameters. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we overview the Moon heat flow measurements and the elemental composition of the moon. In Sect. III we calculate the key quantities: the DM capture rate, the evaporation rate, and the annihilation rate. In Sect. IV we present the exclusion curves for spin-independent interactions of dark matter with protons. Finally, in Sect. V we present concluding remarks. \n## **II.

  "methods": "_Lunar Core_ : Information about the size of the _lunar core_ is derived from reprocessing of Apollo-era seismic analyses [23]. According to the review Ref. [24], existence of a lunar core of a radius 250 _−_ 450 km is suggested. However, there is a debate on the composition of the core. Earlier works have shown that the core could be composed of Fe, FeS, FeS-Fe or Fe-FeS-C alloy, or dense Ti-rich silicate of density _∼_ 8 g _/_ cm[3] , but more data is required to discriminate between them. Note that inferences about core size is highly dependent on the modeled core composition [24]. Also note that there is a “tradeoff” between the sulfur content of the lunar core and its temperature. For instance, a 10% increase of sulfur content decreases the core temperature by 600 K [23]. For the benchmark model MAX we adopt the value of core radius to be 450 km with core density 9 g _/_ cm[3] . For the benchmark model MIN we consider the value of core radius to be 380 km and core density 5 g _/_ cm[3] [22]. For both the cases above we assume a sulfur composition of 5% by weight and core temperature 1700 K. Other parameters are adjusted to reproduce the correct mass and \nradius of the Moon. \n_Lunar Mantle_ : As samples of the lunar mantle have not been identified within the lunar sample collection, information concerning its composition and structure can only come from indirect sources, such as the analyses of the mare basalts and volcanic glasses, and the Apollo seismic data. Investigations of thermodynamically stable mineral phases that are consistent with the Apollo seismic data indicate that the upper 500 km of the mantle is predominantly composed of orthopyroxene, with smaller abundances of olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and garnet. In contrast, the lower mantle is predominately composed of olivine, with lesser quantities of garnet and possibly clinopyroxene [24, 25]. In this work we assume the lunar mantle extends up to 1180 km (1317 km) from the core, and has an average density of _∼_ 3 _._ 2 g _/_ cm[3] ( _∼_ 3 _._ 5 g _/_ cm[3] ) for the benchmark model MAX (MIN), respectively. \n_Lunar Crust_ : Reanalyses of the Apollo seismic data by Refs. [26, 27] imply that the crust beneath the Apollo 12 and 14 sites is between 27 and 50 km thick. We assume that the crust is 57 km (40 km) thick with an average density _∼_ 2 _._ 9 g _/_ cm[3] ( _∼_ 2 _._ 6 g _/_ cm[3] ) for the benchmark model MAX (MIN), respectively. \n**==> picture [168 x 16] intentionally omitted <==**\nwith the normalization constant \n**==> picture [131 x 28] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere _φ_ ( _r_ ) is the gravitational potential of the Moon, _N_ is the total population of DM, and _r_ tidal _∼_ 6 _×_ 10[4] km _∼_ 35 _R_ � is the tidal radius of Moon in the Earth gravitational field [37]. Assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for both DM and lunar matter, the DM temperature _Tχ_ is determined by imposing that there is no net heat transferred between the DM and lunar matter [36, 38]. For DM masses _m_ ≳ 50 GeV, we find that _Tχ_ is equal to the core Moon temperature ( _T_ core). However, for smaller masses _Tχ_ asymptotically reaches 0 _._ 7 _× T_ core. For _σ >_ 10 _[−]_[33] cm[2] the DM interacts with lunar matter more than once per crossing, hence we assume that they are in local thermodynamic equilibrium. In this case the DM distribution is again given by Eq. (3) where _Tχ_ should be replaced by _T_ core. This naive replacement is strictly true only if we consider the Moon to be an isothermal sphere with temperature _T_ = _T_ core = 1700 K, i.e. there are no temperature gradients, otherwise the general expression given in [4, 5, 36] should be utilized. \nHaving determined the DM profile in/around the Moon, we turn to the annihilation and evaporation rates.

Hence, the heat flow is expected to be high along the boundary between highland and mare regions. Upon adjusting the Apollo 17 heat flow for the boundary effect and assuming that the mean megaregolith thickness is 2 km globally, a heat flow of 12 mW _/_ m[2] (0.45 TW total) is reported [33]. The heat flow measured at the Apollo sites is consistent, for a steady state model, with bulk uranium content of _∼_ 40 _×_ 10 _[−]_[9] parts per billion. A similar estimate is obtained from geochemical balance considerations, from correlations among refractory elements ratios [19]. \n_Future prospects_ : There are several planned missions to the moon in the coming decade. Some of these missions are particularly focused on landing a rover on the moon for further geological exploration and mineralogy. It is expected that such exploration would significantly reduce the uncertainties in heat flow measurements and surface composition of the moon. \n## **III. CAPTURE, ANNIHILATION AND EVAPORATION** \nThe captured DM particles thermalize through collisions with the Moon nuclei and form a cloud in the gravitational potential of the Moon. The size of this cloud is determined by the average Moon temperature and the DM mass, and is smaller for larger masses. When it is much smaller than the size of the Moon (at large DM masses exceeding few tens of GeV), the evaporation can be neglected and the annihilation rate equals the capture rate. When the DM cloud is much larger than the size of the Moon (small DM masses) the evaporation becomes dominant over annihilation, and the latter is only a small fraction of the capture rate. In the intermediate case when the size of the DM cloud is comparable to the size of the Moon, the annihilation is still not suppressed, but a sizable fraction of particles annihilate _outside_ the Moon, giving rise to the observable _γ_ -ray flux. \nThe differential equation governing the time evolution of the number of DM particles gravitationally bound to \nthe Moon _N_ is \n**==> picture [174 x 23] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere _C_ is the DM capture rate by the Moon, while second and third terms on the right hand side represent the annihilation and evaporation rates. When equilibrium is reached _dN/dt_ = 0, and the capture rate equals the sum of annihilation and evaporation. The relative strength of these rates is determined by the single combination of parameters, as in the equilibrium one has \n**==> picture [120 x 38] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere \n**==> picture [60 x 12] intentionally omitted <==**\nEvaporation is important at _x ≪_ 1 and negligible in the opposite limit, in which case the annihilation rate becomes equal to the capture rate. \nWe now calculate the three terms in Eq. (1). Consider the capture rate _C_ first. It depends on the Moon composition which we assume to consist of several species with number densities _ni_ ( _r_ ) different in different layers as given in Tabs. I and II, and masses _mi_ . We take into account the motion of the Moon ( _u_ = 220 km/s) with respect to the DM distribution, and assume the latter to be Maxwellian with the velocity dispersion _vd_ = 270 km/s in the galactic rest frame. The capture rate is [34, 35] \n**==> picture [251 x 86] intentionally omitted <==**\nHere _ρ_ DM = 0 _._ 3 GeV/cm[3] is the local DM density, _σi_ is the scattering cross section of DM on nuclei of type _i_ (its relation to _σn_ will be specified in the next section), _u_[2] the dimensionless velocity _η_ = 2[3] _vd_[2][,] _[ v][e]_[(] _[r]_[) is the escape] velocity from radius _r_ , with \n**==> picture [211 x 77] intentionally omitted <==**\nThe last factor in Eq. (2) is responsible for a compositiondependent resonance-like behavior of the capture rate. Note that neglecting the motion of the Moon overestimates the capture rate by approximately factor four. \nBefore we proceed to estimate the evaporation and annihilation rates we have to determine the distribution \n4 \nWe have demonstrated that complimentary constraints can be placed on DM elastic scattering cross section on protons using the available lunar data. Using the fact that the measured internal heat flux of Moon is 12 mW/m[2] we have derived constraints on thermally produced DM by requiring that annihilations from the captured DM should not overshoot this value. Constraints obtained in this way are competitive with similar constraints obtained from the Earth when DM mass matches with that of the target nuclei. We have also shown that for DM in the mass range _∼_ 30 to 50 GeV the thermal radius of the DM cloud accumulated in the Moon is comparable to _R_ � and equilibrium between capture and annihilation can be achieved. In this case a small fraction _∼_ 10 _[−]_[3] of DM annihilates just outside the Moon, leading to potentially observable _γ_ -flux. We have obtained indirect constraints on DM parameters by comparing this flux with that of the Fermi-LAT measurement of 10 _[−]_[4] MeV/cm[2] s at _E ≈_ 100 MeV. \n- [1] M. Tanabashi et al.

Dark matter interactions with muons in neutron stars. _Phys. Rev._ , \nThe constraints derived in this paper are likely to be improved in the future. Several missions to the Moon are expected in the coming decade. New data from such exploration should reduce the current uncertainties on lunar composition, internal heat flow and temperature profile. This is likely to improve the constraints based on the Moon heat flux. Moreover, better understanding of the Moon temperature profile would allow us to more accurately determine the distribution of DM particles gravitaionally bound to the Moon. Consequently, the determination of the DM evaporation mass (i.e. the minimum DM mass for which evaporation would be negligible) and the constraints based on DM annihilations in the Moon limb would be improved. \nAnother potential improvement may be expected from a more detailed analysis of the _γ_ -ray flux from the Moon limb that fits the space and energy distribution of produced photons to the Fermi-LAT data. We leave this for future work. \n## **Acknowledgments** \nWe thank Sergio Palomares-Ruiz for discussions and comments.

We see that for evaporation to be negligible today we require _F <_ 1 _/t_ �, i.e. _F <_ 3 _×_ 10 _[−]_[17] s _[−]_[1] . In the optically thin regime ( _s_ ( _r_ ) = 1), in the limit of equal DM and nuclei temperature, and assuming constant nuclei density, the evaporation rate becomes [5] \n**==> picture [228 x 61] intentionally omitted <==**\nFor example, when the target nuclei are Fe we find that _m_ ≳ 40 GeV for evaporation to be negligible for _σi_ = 10 _[−]_[29] cm[2] . Note that the maximal DM mass for evaporation is approximately set by the mass of the most abundant heaviest element DM scatters on. As illustrated in Sec. II, the core composition is dominated by Fe and the mantle is dominated by O. Consequently the maximal DM mass for evaporation is expected to be in the range _m_ O _< m < m_ Fe. \n_Moon Limb:_ As the Moon does not have an atmosphere, we conservatively define the limb of the Moon to be _rl_ = 3 _× R_ �. The fraction of DM annihilating in the Moon limb is given by \n**==> picture [211 x 33] intentionally omitted <==**\n5 \nhere _nχ_ is obtained by integrating Eq. (A6) over the velocity space. Note that _ξ_ ( _m <_ 60 GeV) _̸_ = 0 due to highly eccentric orbits which are anisotropic. For example, we find _ξ_ ( _m_ = 40 GeV) _≈_ 6 _×_ 10 _[−]_[3] . Note also that tidal stripping of DM bound to the Moon due to the gravitational field of the Earth is only important if DM thermal radius extends beyond _∼_ 35 R�, in which case the evaporation is too efficient for any constraints to be placed. \nTo be specific, in the following we consider the spinindependent elastic scattering cross section of DM on nucleons, _σn_ = _σp_[SI][. For a nucleus N with atomic mass] _[ A][i]_ and charge _Zi_ , assuming isospin equivalence, the DMnucleus spin-independent elastic scattering cross section is \n**==> picture [171 x 28] intentionally omitted <==**\n_µr[A][i][, µ][p] r_[are reduced mass of nucleus-DM and proton-DM] respectively. Inserting this cross section in Eq. (2) we evaluate the capture rate. As mentioned before DM heating of the Moon is given by _m C_ . In the upper panels of Fig. 1 we present the exclusion curves (solid red) resulting from requirement that heating due to DM annihilations in the Moon should not exceed the measured value of heat flow of 12 mW/m[2] , for reference Moon models MAX (left) and MIN (right). We assume the DM annihilation rate to be 3 _×_ 10 _[−]_[26] cm[3] /s, which corresponds to the value for a thermal relic. We also assume that all the decay products of DM annihilation decay inside the Moon. For comparison we also present existing constraints on SI DM-proton cross section obtained from various other probes, in particular from DM heating of Earth (solid black). In the red hatched regions the captured DM is efficiently evaporated from the Moon and constraints from heating do not hold. Interestingly, we find that the maximum evaporation DM mass is _∼_ 40 GeV for _σp_[SI] _[∼]_[10] _[−]_[33] cm[2] , for both the models MAX and MIN. Similarly we find that the DM evaporation mass for the Earth is _∼_ 10 GeV for _σp_[SI] _[∼]_[10] _[−]_[34][ cm][2][. The critical cross section] (i.e. the geometric cross section per nuclei) for the Moon (Earth) is about 10 _[−]_[32] cm[2] (10 _[−]_[33] cm[2] ). For cross sections below that value, DM accretion is not efficient and crucially depends on the kinematics of scattering, resulting in ’resonance-like’ enhancements as noted in [34]. For the Moon, the most prominent peaks appear when DM mass matches that of the most abundant targets, which are iron, oxygen and silicon, respectively. Finally, these constraints do not extend infinitely to very large cross sections. Similar to the case of the Earth, for _σp_[SI][≳][10] _[−]_[23] cm[2] DM gets stuck close to the surface thereby occupying a larger volume which suppresses the annihilation rate. However, we can still exclude some regions of parameter space with large cross sections that cannot be accessed by direct detection experiments. We evaluate this maximum cross section that could be constrained by balancing \ngraviational force and drag force [50, 51]. We obtain the upper limit on the cross section by imposing DM particles at the surface drifts and settles within the thermal radius ( _Rth_ ) in 4 Gyrs. Furthermore, similar constraints can be placed on the spin dependent DM proton cross section. The resulting bounds can be obtained by an appropriate rescaling of Eq. (8). \nAs mentioned before the DM thermal radius can be comparable to that of the Moon for DM mass _∼O_ (10) GeV, in which case some of the DM may annihilate just outside the moon forming a limb. The differential flux of _γ_ -rays from annihilations in the limb is then given by \n**==> picture [203 x 28] intentionally omitted <==**\nwith _ξ_ ( _m_ ) defined in Eq. (7). Here, _d_ = 3 _._ 8 _×_ 10[5] km is the distance between the Moon and the Earth, Γ = 1 _/_ 2 _AN_[2] is the total annihilation rate and d _Nγ/_ d _E_ is the photon spectrum arising from a given final state, which we compute using Pythia [52]. \nIn the lower panels of Fig. 1 we present the exclusion curves resulting from DM annihilations in the Moon limb, for reference Moon models MAX (left) and MIN (right). The purple curve correspond to the case when DM annihilates only to[¯] _bb_ and the orange curve to _τ_[+] _τ[−]_ , respectively. \nFinally, comments are in order regarding possible constraints that could arise from DM annihilations in the Earth and Sun limbs. The approximate mass range where limb signals are important is few times the maximal evaporation mass for the assumed astrophysical object. As already mentioned, the evaporation mass for the Earth is _∼_ 10 GeV, so the annihilations in the Earth limb are maximized for DM in the mass range 10 _−_ 20 GeV. At heavier masses the annihilation fraction _ξ_ , Eq. (7), vanishes exponentially. In the case of the Sun, it is well known that the evaporation mass is about 4 GeV for SI interactions. Therefore, DM annihilations in the solar limb could be important in the mass range 4 _−_ 10 GeV. However, backgrounds from cosmic ray interactions with the solar chromosphere could pose a significant challenge [53]. A precise determination of the above constraints are left for future work. \nIt is important to note that several studies have examined gamma-rays from DM annihilations in the halo around the Sun [54–58].
