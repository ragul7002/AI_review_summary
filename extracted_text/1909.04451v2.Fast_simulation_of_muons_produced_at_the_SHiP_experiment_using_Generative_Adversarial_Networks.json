The SHiP detector needs\nto operate under ultra-low background conditions and requires large simulated samples of muon\ninduced background processes. Through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks it is possible\nto emulate the simulation of the interaction of 400 GeV/c proton beams with the SHiP target,\nan otherwise computationally intensive process.\nFor the simulation requirements of the SHiP\nexperiment, generative networks are capable of approximating the full simulation of the dense ﬁxed\ntarget, oﬀering a speed increase by a factor of O(106). To evaluate the performance of such an\napproach, comparisons of the distributions of reconstructed muon momenta in SHiP’s spectrometer\nbetween samples using the full simulation and samples produced through generative models are\npresented.

Generative\nnetworks have been studied in the machine learning community primarily for the purpose of image\ngeneration. Each image in a training set is made up of a multitude of pixels, corresponding to\na data point in a high dimensional space. Within this space, underlying features of the set of\nimages are encoded through dependencies between pixels. Generative networks attempt to model\nthe characteristics that deﬁne a speciﬁc set of training images. These models can then be used to\ngenerate images that are faithful emulations of the original training set. Generative networks have\nbeen successfully employed for a variety of applications such as: generating high quality images\nthat obey fundamental features of training set images; the generation of images from descriptive\ntext [1]; modelling image captions [2]; producing photo realistic super resolution images [3]; and\ngenerating high resolution images from semantic mapping [4, 5].\nSearches for physics beyond the Standard Model often involve looking for rare signatures and\nmust therefore be able to suppress background processes which can be many orders of magni-\ntude more abundant than the signal. In order to optimise the design of the detectors, develop\n– 1 –\n\nreconstruction algorithms and understand the eﬃciency of the selection criteria, large samples of\nsimulated background events are required. Dedicated software packages such as GEANT4 [6] model\nthe transport of particles through the material and the detector response. In many cases, the CPU\nrequirements to simulate these interactions with matter prohibit the production of large numbers\nof background events due to the computationally expensive procedure. Therefore, the computing\ndemands of the simulation of high energy physics experiments are incre"
