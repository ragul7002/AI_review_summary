  "abstract": "Data science has become increasingly essential for the production of official statistics, as it enables\nthe automated collection, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. With such data science\npractices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the\nquality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data\nsources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources\nare inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine\nlearning for official statistics.\nThis paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing\ndata sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the\nmost prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also\nregarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception.",

  "methodology": "such as surveys and censuses have provided valuable insights into\na wide range of topics, from population demographics to economic trends and public opinion. However, in recent years,\nthe increasing availability of open and large data sources has opened up new opportunities for statistical analysis. In\nparticular, the rise of machine learning has transformed the field of statistics, enabling the analysis of massive datasets,\nthe identification of complex patterns and relationships, non-linear forecasting, etc. [1, 2]. Machine learning algorithms\ncan be used to analyze data from a wide range of sources, providing insights that traditional survey methods may not\ncapture.\nThe use of machine learning for official statistics has the potential to provide more timely, accurate and comprehensive\ninsights into a wide range of societal topics [3].",
  "results": ". This can\nhave serious implications, especially when the model is being used for official statistics, where accuracy and reliability\nare of paramount importance. Therefore, it is essential to take measures to prevent and mitigate such changes. This is\nnot an easy task, as the consequences can be diverse, and the required efforts to mitigate them are often time-consuming\nand not straightforward. We do not claim to have definite answers.",
  "discussion": "",
  "conclusion": "In this paper we have investigated the risks and consequences of changing data sources when using machine learning\nfor official statistics. The list is long and covers many different aspects, ranging from statistical issues and model\ninconsistencies to technical problems and ethical considerations. We have also looked at a few potential mitigation\nstrategies. However, we admit that these strategies do not provide all the adequate answers and might leave the reader\nunsatisfied or, worse still, beguiled, as the solutions require many additional resources and efforts. As we have stressed\na couple of times in this paper, this is a story of trade-offs.",
