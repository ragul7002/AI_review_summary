  "abstract": "—Games often incorporate random elements in the\nform of dice or shuffled card decks. This randomness is a key\ncontributor to the player experience and the variety of game\nsituations encountered. There is a tension between a level of\nrandomness that makes the game interesting and contributes\nto the player enjoyment of a game, and a level at which the\noutcome itself is effectively random and the game becomes dull.\nThe optimal level for a game will depend on the design goals\nand target audience. We introduce a new technique to quantify\nthe level of randomness in game outcome and use it to compare\n15 tabletop games and disentangle the different contributions to\nthe overall randomness from specific parts of some games. We\nfurther explore the interaction between game randomness and\nplayer skill, and how this innate randomness can affect error\nanalysis in common game experiments.\nI.",
  "introduction": "Games can vary significantly in their levels of randomness.\nPerfect information games like Chess eliminate chance en-\ntirely. Others, such as Poker and Bridge, introduce randomness\nthrough the initial deal of cards. This randomness, coupled\nwith hidden information, contributes to the unpredictable\nnature of these games. Both types of games have enjoyed\nenduring popularity, demonstrating that randomness is neither\na prerequisite nor a detriment to a game’s success.\nIn contemporary game design, particularly tabletop games,\nrandomness, whether through dice, card shuffling, or other\nmechanisms, is a fundamental design tool [1]–[3].

  "methodology": "For each game 200 different random seeds are sampled. For\neach random seed 1000 games are run and the win rate of the\nfirst player measured (a draw is counted as 0.5 of a win). For\neach of these 1000 games the MCTS players have different\nrandom seeds. This gives a sample of 200 different win rates.\nIf the stochastic elements of the game have no net impact\non the outcome then this distribution of 200 win rates (one per\nseed) will be tightly clustered around pµ. If the game has no\nfirst player advantage then pµ = 0.5, but this is not required.\nEach of the mean win rates is the average of 1000 independent\ngames, so 99% confidence bounds can be calculated from a\nBinomial(1000, pµ) distribution.",

  "discussion": "of interesting\nforms of game uncertainty from a design perspective. This\nwork deals purely with randomness as one of these eleven\ntypes; the uncertainty in outcome of a game due to random\nnumber generation as part of the game rules, such as dice rolls\nor card shuffles.\nWe look at the effect of stochasticity in a number of different\ntabletop board games to quantify the impact of randomness in\neach game. It builds on previous work published at the IEEE\nConference on Games in 2024 [5]. This asked two key research\nquestions:\n1) Does the randomness integral to the game rules affect the\nresult and if so, how big is this effect?\n2) If this randomness does have a significant effect, can the\ndifferent contributions be disentangled and attributed to\ndifferent sources of randomness in the game, such the\nshuffle of specific decks of cards, or an initial randomised\nboard set up.\nThe main results from this work are re-presented here and\nextended in three areas:\n3) How does the skill of an agent interact with randomness\nin a game? The original work used agents of a single skill\nlevel.",
  "conclusion": "is: I had to create quite unbalanced\nabilities. [23]\nIn Dominion the impact is dominated by the initial shuffle\nand the content of the first two hands. Fixing just this first\nshuffle gives 43% outliers compared to only slightly more\n(56%) across all variation. A game of Dominion using the\nrecommended first game cards involves 5-10 reshuffles of each\ndeck after the original one and these have less impact. The\noverall impact of randomness in Dominion remains low in\ncomparison to other imperfect information games looked at.\nIn Theme Park the total variation in outcome is more evenly\nbalanced between the two components, with the Magic Card\ndeck shuffle having a slightly larger impact; 71% outliers and\na trimmed span of 0.31 versus 54% and 0.29 for Person cards.\nThe Person cards are all dealt at the start of the game and\nare public information.",
