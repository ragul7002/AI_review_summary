We call] �2nn� the central binomial coefficient (cf. [4, A000984]). The binomial coefficients �63nn� is the sequence [4, A066802] and �3nn� is the sequence [4, A005809]. \nAccording to (1.1), Z. W. Sun [6] introduced the following integer sequence [4, A176898]. \n**==> picture [145 x 37] intentionally omitted <==**\nHere we list the values of S1, S2, . . . , S8 as follows: \n5, 231, 14568, 1062347, 84021990, 7012604550, 607892634420, 54200780036595. \nZ.

Besides, we confirm Conjecture 1.1 , i.e., \nTheorem 1.2 Conjecture 1.1 is true. \n2 \n## 2 Trigonometric Series \nBefore proving Theorem 1.2, we need some formulas and series expansions on trigonometric functions. We first note that \n**==> picture [219 x 24] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere x ∈ [−1, 1]. What’s more, the basic fact \ncos(α − β) = cos α cos β + sin α sin β (2.2) \nis needed. \nHere we also use two trigonometric series in [5, Ex. 44, p. 51], namely, \n**==> picture [304 x 45] intentionally omitted <==**\nand \n**==> picture [9 x 11] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [276 x 45] intentionally omitted <==**\nWith the formula (2.3) in hand, it is not difficult to derive the identities (1.2) and (1.3). \nTo begin with, we consider the uniform convergence of series (1.2). Due to Stirling [2], we hold the following approximate formula, which was called Stirling’s formula, \n**==> picture [36 x 18] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [262 x 33] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere Γ(α) is the gamma function and is defined by \n**==> picture [25 x 18] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [155 x 21] intentionally omitted <==**\nFor more information on this formula, one can consult [2]. By Stirling’s formula (2.5), we have \n**==> picture [23 x 14] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [235 x 21] intentionally omitted <==**\nThus by Cauchy-Hadamard’s theorem and (2.6), the series[�][∞] n=0[S][n][x][n][ is] 1 uniformly convergent for 0 < x < 108[.] So, before we make operations on[�][∞] n=0[S][n][x][n][, we designate][ x][ ∈][(0][,][ 1][/][108) in order that all the following] operations are well defined. \n3 \nTheorem 2.1 For all a, b ∈ R and bx ∈ [−1, 1], we have \n**==> picture [301 x 32] intentionally omitted <==**\nwhere C is any constant. \nNow we are in a position to consider formulas (1.2) and (1.3). \n**==> picture [297 x 139] intentionally omitted <==**\n(i) As to (1.2), let t = 2/3 and x = 6 \nwhich is nothing but (1.2). \n(ii) For (1.3), let \n**==> picture [204 x 32] intentionally omitted <==**\nThanks to (i), we get \n**==> picture [272 x 162] intentionally omitted <==**\nFrom Theorem 2.1, it follows that \nwhich indicates \nTherefore, we can deduce identity (1.3) by invoking (2.8) and (2.9) . \n4 \nProposition 2.2 For all t ∈ R and x ∈ [−1, 1], we have \nsin([πt] 2[) sin(][t][ arcsin(][x][)) + cos(][πt] 2[) cos(][t][ arcsin(][x][)) = cos(][t][ arccos(][x][))][.] \n## 3 Proof of the Theorem 1.2 \nWe shall give two lemmas before giving the proof of Theorem 1.2. The first lemma is Fermat’s simple theorem [1]. \nLemma 3.1 If a is any integer prime to m, and if m is prime, then a[m][−][1] ≡ 1 (mod m). \nLemma 3.2 For any prime p, we have \n**==> picture [124 x 39] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [234 x 81] intentionally omitted <==**\nand \n**==> picture [149 x 59] intentionally omitted <==**",
  "conclusion": "Now we can prove Theorem 1.2. \n5 \nProof of Theorem 1.2. Firstly, we need to point out that (1.5) can be rewritten as follows: \n**==> picture [333 x 32] intentionally omitted <==**\nBy Proposition 2.2, for k = 1, 2, 3, . . ., if we can find Tk such that \n**==> picture [175 x 33] intentionally omitted <==**\nthen we can prove the first part of Conjecture 1.1. \nBy (2.4), we see that \n**==> picture [284 x 110] intentionally omitted <==**\nFor integers n ≥ 1, if we set Tn = 24(316n[n] −1) �3nn�, thus obtaining the desired sequence (Tn)n≥1 for Conjecture 1.1. \nIt is clear that \n**==> picture [217 x 40] intentionally omitted <==**\n**==> picture [16 x 11] intentionally omitted <==**\nis an integer. One can refer to [7] for details. In view of Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, we can get Tp ≡−2 (mod p) for any prime p. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.2. \nAcknowledgements.
