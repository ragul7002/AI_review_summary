  "abstract": ": The SHiP experiment will search for very weakly interacting particles beyond the\nStandard Model which are produced in a 400 GeV/c proton beam dump at the CERN SPS. About\n1011 muons per spill will be produced in the dump.\nTo design the experiment such that the\nmuon-induced background is minimized, a precise knowledge of the muon spectrum is required.\nTo validate the muon ﬂux generated by our Pythia and GEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulation\n(FairShip), we have measured the muon ﬂux emanating from a SHiP-like target at the SPS. This\ntarget, consisting of 13 interaction lengths of slabs of molybdenum and tungsten, followed by\na 2.4 m iron hadron absorber was placed in the H4 400 GeV/c proton beam line.\nTo identify\nmuons and to measure the momentum spectrum, a spectrometer instrumented with drift tubes\nand a muon tagger were used. During a three-week period a dataset for analysis corresponding to\n(3.27±0.07) × 1011 protons on target was recorded. This amounts to approximatively 1% of a SHiP spill.\n© CERN for the beneﬁt of the SHiP collaboration.\nKeywords: Fixed target experiments\n– 1 –\n\n1",

  "conclusion": "s\nWe have measured the muon ﬂux from 400 GeV/c protons impinging on a heavy tungsten/molybdenum\ntarget. The physics processes underlying this are a combination of the production of muons through\ndecays of non-interacting pions and kaons, the production and decays of charm particles and low-mass\nresonances, and the transportation of the muons through 2.4 m iron. Some 20–30% diﬀerences in\n– 7 –\n\nthe absolute rates are observed. The simulation underestimates contributions to larger transverse\nmomentum for higher muon momenta. Given the complexity of the underlying processes, the agreement\nbetween the prediction by the simulation and the measured rate is remarkable.\nSystematic errors for the track reconstruction (3%) and POT normalization (15 POT)/µ-event\nhave been studied and estimated.\nA further understanding of the simulation and the data will be obtained with an analysis of di-muon\nevents, the results of which will be the subject of a future publication.\n7\nAcknowledgments\nThe SHiP Collaboration acknowledges support from the following Funding Agencies: the National\nResearch Foundation of Korea (with grant numbers of 2018R1A2B2007757, 2018R1D1A3B07050649,\n2018R1D1A1B07050701, 2017R1D1A1B03036042, 2017R1A6A3A01075752, 2016R1A2B4012302, and\n2016R1A6A3A11930680); the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR, grant 17-02-00607) and\nthe TAEK of Turkey.\nThis work is supported by a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network Fellowship of\nthe European Commissions Horizon 2020 Programme under contract number 765710 INSIGHTS.\nWe thank M.
