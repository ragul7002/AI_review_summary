  "introduction": "Electric bicycles (e-bikes) have experienced a sharp rise in popularity, driven by their convenience, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benefits. In the United States, sales surged from fewer than 300,000 in 2019 to over 1.1 million in 2022, a nearly fourfold increase [1]. Interest and usage have grown as well: the share of American bike riders who reported using an e-bike more than doubled, from 7.8% in 2021 to 19.4% in 2023 [2]. However, this growth has been paralleled by a concerning increase in safety-related incidents. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reports that from 2017 to 2021, there were 53 deaths associated with the use of e-bikes [3]. Moreover, e-bike injuries accounted for approximately 15% of all reported micromobility-related injuries during the same period [4]. These trends underscore the urgent need to examine the mechanical, electrical, and human factors contributing to e-bike incidents. A critical component of this effort is investigating strategies to enhance rider safety. For example, the use of protective equipment, particularly helmets, remains a primary safeguard, directly reducing the severity of head injuries. Helmet use has been shown to lower the probability of fatal head injuries on e-bikes by 10%, from 89% \nto 79% [5]. Nevertheless, the residual risk remains substantial, highlighting the need for continued improvements. Advances in e-bike technology provide a complementary pathway to address diverse safety challenges. Recently, researchers have developed devices aimed at preventing accidents related to charging. One such innovation is SingMonitor [6], which leverages mobile device microphones to remotely monitor and evaluate the charging health of e-bike batteries. \nAlthough some preventive measures, emerging technologies, and recent policies have been effective in specific contexts for enhancing e-bike safety, they are not easily extendable to a comprehensive, systematic analysis of e-bike accident causes and impacts. This limitation arises from the scarcity of representative data, the diversity of data structures, and the prevalence of text-based incident descriptions, which are difficult for human experts to systematically interpret and analyze. Developing universal frameworks capable of integrating these unstructured accident descriptors, uncovering hidden patterns, and generating actionable safety insights is therefore essential. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence provide powerful tools to address these challenges. For example, tree-structured machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to analyze risk patterns among e- bike riders in China [7]. Large Language Models (LLMs) are particularly well-suited for handling and analyzing unstructured data; in the domain of autonomous systems, surveys have shown how foundation models are applied in end-to-end tasks such as perception, reasoning, simulation and planning in driving contexts [8] — however, their application in traffic accident analysis remains relatively novel. Agentic systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the mining of unstructured data across diverse fields, demonstrating strong performance in analyzing highly heterogeneous datasets and delivering comprehensive insights that advance specialized scientific domains. This success stems largely from recent technical advancements. One standard approach to adapting large language models to domain-specific data is supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Recent work, however, has shown that SFT does not always degrade general capabilities when properly \ntuned (e.g., small learning rates) [9]. Besides, reinforcement learning has enhanced models’ reasoning capacity, enabling stronger multistep logical problem-solving, particularly in multi-agent systems [10, 11]. These reasoning capabilities have already shown promise in areas such as biomedicine [12, 13, 14], recommendation systems [15, 16], and fake news detection [17, 18, 19]. Moreover, improvements in algorithms and hardware have significantly increased the efficiency of LLM training and inference [20, 21]. \nSpecifically, this paper investigates the use of emerging LLM-based tools to address the challenges of mining unstructured data in the context of e-bike and bicycle accidents (Figure 1). Our analysis draws on two widely used consumer safety datasets: the CPSRMS (Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System Information Security Review Report) and NEISS (National Electronic Injury Surveillance System). Both provide structured injury records with welldefined product categorizations, alongside narrative incident reports. We examine how LLM-powered agents can transform these narratives into actionable insights by extracting critical safety-related information and converting it into structured formats. This approach enables the identification of key human, environmental, and equipment-related factors that influence both the occurrence and severity of e-bike incidents. More broadly, the study illustrates how AI-driven data processing can advance our understanding of e-bike safety risks, thereby supporting evidence-based policymaking and informing the development of improved design standards. \n## II.

Classification Results_ \nfrequency observed in 2022. Adults, seniors, and males were disproportionately affected. The NEISS dataset shows similar patterns: most incidents occurred on streets or highways, with adults and males being most affected. Additionally, the NEISS data indicate that white individuals are disproportionately represented among those injured in bicycle and e-bike incidents. Figures 3 and 4 summarize these findings. \n**==> picture [253 x 378] intentionally omitted <==**\n**Fig. 3:** Distribution of CPSRMS bicycle- and e-bike–related incidents by location, land use, year, gender, and age category. \n_2) Causes of bike and ebike accidents:_ We determined the leading causes of bike and e-bike injuries categorized by age and gender (Figures 5 6). Collisions and falls consistently appear among the top three causes for all groups, indicating that reasonable infrastructure design and bike and e-bike design enhancements are important to reduce bike and e-bike injuries. Additionally, equipment-related problems, particularly issues with batteries, pedals, and malfunctions, are common causes of injury. These findings can guide bike and bike design enhancements for safer use. \nFor the CPSRMS dataset, the analysis identified collisions, bike falls, and loss of control as the main human-related causes. Equipment-related problems mainly involve pedals, batteries, \nand malfunctions. For NEISS dataset, the incidents are mainly related to human-related incidents, which indicate similar main human-related causes. Figures 7 8 illustrate the leading causes in human, equipment, and combined incidents. \n**==> picture [253 x 379] intentionally omitted <==**\n**Fig. 4:** Distribution of NEISS bicycle- and e-bike–related incidents by location, land use, year, gender, and age category. \n**==> picture [253 x 94] intentionally omitted <==**\n**Fig. 7:** Top three most frequent injury causes of bicycle and e-bike incidents in the CPSRMS dataset, categorized as human-related, equipment-related, or both. \n**==> picture [253 x 189] intentionally omitted <==**\n**Fig. 5:** Top three most frequent injury causes of bicycle and e-bike incidents by age group and gender in the CPSRMS dataset. \n**==> picture [253 x 158] intentionally omitted <==**\n**Fig. 6:** Top three most frequent injury causes of bicycle and e-bike incidents by age group and gender in the NEISS dataset. \n**==> picture [253 x 95] intentionally omitted <==**\n**Fig. 8:** Top three most frequent injury causes of bicycle and e-bike incidents in the NEISS dataset, categorized as human-related, equipment-related, or both. \n_3) Injury severity analysis:_ In our study, we examined the injury severity as detailed in the dataset.

If such a keyword is detected, the incident is labeled as “yes”; otherwise, it is labeled as “no.” This classification then serves as the input for the subsequent three agents. \n_4) Incident-Component Link Detector:_ Finally, the incident–component link detector assesses whether an incident is associated with specific e-bike (or bile) components, as defined in Table I. This provides insights into the components most frequently linked to incidents. \n**TABLE II:** Predictor Variables: Definitions, Source, and Counts by Dataset \n|**Variable**|**Defnition & Values**|**Source**|**Count (CPSRMS Bike /**|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||||**CPSRMS E-Bike / NEISS Bike**|\n||||**/ NEISS E-Bike)**|\n||1: Children (_≤_14)|Already Exist|17 / 6 / 3 / 10|\n|Age|2: Youth (15–24)<br>3: Adults (25–64)|Already Exist<br>Already Exist|15 / 8 / 1 / 9<br>97 / 54 / 4 / 44|\n||4: Seniors (65+)|Already Exist|34 / 16 / 3 / 13|\n|Gender|1: Female|Already Exist|47 / 34 / 3 / 10|\n||2: Male|Already Exist|116 / 87 / 5 / 40|\n||1: Human-Related (e.g., collisions, rule|Extracted|106 / 88 / 4 / 42|\n|Incident Cause and Type|breaks)|||\n||2: Equipment-Related (e.g., battery, brake|Extracted|96 / 100 / 5 / 47|\n||issues)|||\n||3: Both|Extracted|9 / 9 / 0 / 7|\n|Weather|1: Favorable (clear, unspecifed)|Extracted|161 / 99 / NA / NA|\n||2: Adverse (rain, snow, fog)|Extracted|2 / 4 / NA / NA|\n|Road Condition|1: Favorable (dry, unspecifed)|Extracted|156 / 97 / NA / NA|\n||2: Adverse (wet, icy, potholes)|Extracted|7 / 6 / NA / NA|\n|Time|1: Favorable (daylight, unspecifed)|Extracted|155 / 95 / NA / NA|\n||2: Adverse (night, midnight)|Extracted|8 / 8 / NA / NA|\n||1.0|Extracted|108 / 80 / 71 / 920|\n|Number of|2.0|Extracted|45 / 21 / 34 / 577|\n|Transportation Modes|3.0|Extracted|7 / 3 / 9 / 155|\n||4.0|Extracted|3 / 1 / 4 / 15|\n**TABLE I:** Mechanical and visibility components explored and corresponding keywords \n|**Mechanical/Visibility**|**Keyword(s)**|\n|---|---|\n|**Component**||\n|Brake System|Brake, Pads, Cable|\n|Steering System|Handlebar, Stem, Cockpit|\n|Pedals|Pedal|\n|Drive System|Drive belt or chain|\n|Wheel/Tire|Wheel or Tire, Spokes|\n|Front Fork|Front Fork|\n|Frame|Bicycle Frame|\n|Saddles/Seats|Saddle or Seat|\n|Visibility|Lamp, Lights, Refectors|\nsequential categories in CPSRMS and four categories in NEISS. For CPSRMS, severity ranges from 1 (Incident, no injury – least severe) to 7 (Death – most severe). The classification is based on CPSRMS report descriptions and internal coding, which differs substantially from the conventional KABCOU scale commonly used in U.S. crash data (typically four or five levels, depending on the state) [34]. For NEISS, severity is derived from the standardized diagnosis variable (diag), which captures treatment outcomes (e.g., treated and released versus hospitalized), and spans from 1 (Mild – least severe) to 4 (Fatal – most severe). Records with undefined severity values (-1) were excluded from both datasets. \nFor an ordinal outcome variable ordered categories _Y_ and _K_ , the model can be expressed as Equation 1: \n## _B. Incident Severity Analysis-Ordered Logit Model_ \nWe investigate the relationship between severity levels and incident-related factors using an ordered logit model, which is well suited for analyzing ordinal dependent variables. Such variables are ranked but the differences between categories are neither equal nor precisely measurable. In this study, severity level is treated as an ordinal outcome, defined with seven \n**==> picture [184 x 13] intentionally omitted <==**\n- _P_ ( _Y ≤ j_ ) is the cumulative probability that the response is in category _j_ or lower. \n- _θj_ are the threshold parameters that separate the categories. \n**==> picture [166 x 10] intentionally omitted <==**\n- _**β**_ is the vector of coefficients for the predictor variables. \nFor predictor variables _X_ , we incorporate variables that might impact incident severity, encompassing both those in the dataset and those extracted from the narrative variable via the ChatGPT model. Table II details these predictor variables, indicating their dataset origin or extraction status. \nDue to the high proportion (76%) of unspecified race data in the e-bike incident dataset, the race variable was omitted from the analysis as it would likely contribute little variance to the regression model. To better understand the impact of weather, road conditions, and time on severity, these variables were divided into adverse and favorable categories. Weather was labeled as adverse (2) for conditions such as rain, snow, or fog, and favorable (1) otherwise or if unspecified. Road conditions were deemed adverse (2) for wet, icy, or dangerous settings, and favorable (1) for dry or unspecified situations. Similarly, time was considered adverse (2) during evening, night, or midnight, and favorable (1) during day or when unspecified. An ordered logit model was used via the “ologit” command in STATA to evaluate these variables’ effects on severity and their statistical significance. \n**==> picture [81 x 10] intentionally omitted <==**\nThe experiments in this section are designed to address the following research questions: (1) What demographic characteristics are associated with bike and e-bike incidents? (2) How are incidents distributed across human-, equipment-, or combined-related causes? (3) What age- and gender-related patterns emerge in common injury causes? (4) What are the most frequent injury causes linked to human, equipment, or combined factors? (5) What severity levels are most prevalent by age and gender? (6) How are severity levels distributed across human-, equipment-, or combined-related incidents? (7) What is the correlation between incident factors for bikes and e-bikes and the resulting severity levels? \n## _A. Experiment Settings_ \n_1) Datasets:_ This study draws on two complementary data sources: the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). Both are maintained by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and provide detailed records of consumer product–related injuries, including those involving micromobility devices such as bicycles and e-bikes. The CPSRMS dataset consists of incident reports submitted by consumers, manufacturers, and health professionals between 2017 and 2023. Each record includes structured fields, such as incident year, location, severity, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age and gender), as well as unstructured components, most notably a free-text narrative describing the incident. Because key variables (e.g., weather, road conditions, and contributing causes) are often embedded within these narratives, advanced natural language processing techniques are required for systematic extraction. Using a classification agent to detect e-bike–related keywords, we identified 460 e-bike incidents and 133 traditional bicycle incidents in CPSRMS. The NEISS dataset, by contrast, is a \nstructured surveillance system that contains standardized fields such as product codes (to classify incident types), diagnosis, injury location, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes. Each record also includes a brief narrative (narr) that provides contextual details and can be leveraged to extract supplementary information (e.g., crash mechanism or helmet use). For this study, we analyzed NEISS records from 2017 to 2023 and identified 1,675 e-bike–related cases and 120 traditional bicycle cases. Compared with traditional transportation safety databases such as FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System [35]) or CRSS (Crash Report Sampling System [36]), which rely solely on predefined structured variables, CPSRMS poses greater analytical challenges because of its narrative-rich format. NEISS, by contrast, provides consistent coding of injury characteristics while still offering contextual details through its short narrative field. By integrating these two sources—CPSRMS, which blends structured and narrative data, and NEISS, which is predominantly structured with supplementary narrative—we enable a more robust comparative analysis of injury causes, affected populations, and severity outcomes across e-bike and traditional bicycle incidents[1] . This dual-dataset framework offers a more comprehensive perspective on emerging micromobility safety trends. \n_2) LLM Model details:_ In this study, we apply the GPT4 [37] model to execute the four agents mentioned in Section 3.1. We use zero-shot prompting and Table III provides detailed examples of the prompts used and the corresponding expected outcomes for each variable we seek to extract. \nShould corresponding information be absent, the output will state, \"There are no certain information mentioned in the incident.\" The variables extracted, transportation mode, time, weather, road conditions, and cause of the incident, were selected because they are often cited in literature as crucial factors in accident occurrence and severity [38, 39, 40]. Other variables were omitted either due to inconsistent narrative reporting or minimal relevance to severity modeling. \n||**Caused By**|**TP**|**FP**|**FN**||**PrecisionRecall**|**PrecisionRecall**|**F1**|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||||**Score**|\n||Brake System|23|1|8||0.96|0.74|0.84|\n||Pedal|91|0|23||1.00|0.80|0.89|\n||Wheel/Tire|37|3|3||0.93|0.93|0.93|\n||Seat|1|0|2||1.00|0.33|0.50|\n||Front Fork|11|1|4||0.92|0.73|0.81|\n||Visibility Issues|4|2|0||0.67|1.00|0.80|\n||Drive Belt/Chain|4|1|0||0.80|1.00|0.89|\n||Bicycle Frame|5|0|2||1.00|0.71|0.83|\n||Steering System<br>**Weighted F1 Score**|6|0|4|**0.87**|1.00|0.60|0.75|\n||**Caused By**|**TP**|**FP**|**FN**||**PrecisionRecall**|**PrecisionRecall**|**F1**<br>**Score**|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Brake System<br>Pedal<br>Wheel/Tire<br>Saddle/Seat<br>Front Fork|13<br>3<br>34<br>4<br>8|4<br>0<br>4<br>1<br>0|4<br>1<br>2<br>2<br>0||0.76<br>1.00<br>0.89<br>0.80<br>1.00|0.76<br>0.75<br>0.94<br>0.67<br>1.00|0.76<br>0.86<br>0.92<br>0.73<br>1.00|\n||Visibility Issues<br>Drive Belt/Chain|3<br>5|2<br>1|0<br>0||0.60<br>1.00|1.00<br>0.83|0.75<br>0.91|\n||Bicycle Frame|1|0|1||1.00|0.50|0.67|\n||Steering System|8|8|4||0.50|0.67|0.57|\n||**Weighted F1 Score**||||**0.84**||||\n## _C.

Given their more complex mechanical and electrical systems, it is important to examine the specific components—particularly mechanical ones—that may contribute to injury risk. Understanding these differences can offer insights into design, maintenance, and safety improvements tailored for e-bikes.We utilized the reported field containing a narrative of the incident to investigate the link between e- bike mechanical components and the incidents. Our goal was \nto assess whether each incident was associated with certain e-bike components and if the component directly caused the incident. Figure 15 and 16 present the count of incidents in the CPSRMS and NEISS dataset associated with and caused by these mechanical/visibility components. \nThe analysis identified that the pedal, wheel/tire, brake systems and steering systems are the most commonly mentioned keywords in e-bike incident reports, as well as the main contributors to these incidents. This indicates that e-bike standards should place greater emphasis on these components. Although less frequently, components like the front fork, bike frame, and seat were also mentioned in reports. \n_D.

Age plays an important role: _agecategory×ebikedummy_ is negative and highly significant ( _β_ = _−_ 0 _._ 677, _p <_ 0 _._ 01), implying that older individuals in e-bike incidents tend to experience less severe outcomes, possibly due to more cautious behavior. In contrast, the corresponding bicycle interaction is positive but not significant. \nIncident type also matters. Equipment-related incidents for bicycles show a strong negative and significant effect ( _equipment-related×bikedummy_ ; _β_ = _−_ 2 _._ 084, _p <_ 0 _._ 01), indicating that equipment-related factors are associated with less severe outcomes in traditional bike cases. For e-bikes, \nhowever, equipment-related incidents are positive but not significant, highlighting a mode-specific difference. \nContextual factors are also important.

By contrast, human- and bothrelated categories show no significant effects in this dataset. \neffects, where sex, age, and specific environments shape injury outcomes. Taken together, these findings highlight the need for targeted safety interventions that differentiate between e-bike and bicycle users, as well as between rider demographics and environmental contexts. \noccur. This distinction suggests that improving rider education and behavior may be more effective for reducing injury severity, while equipment standards and regulation can help reduce incident occurrence in the first place. \nFrom a policy perspective, the findings stress the importance of tailoring interventions to the unique characteristics of e- bike use. Infrastructure planning should account for urban areas where risks of higher-severity injuries are concentrated, while safety campaigns may need to target male and younger riders who are at disproportionate risk. For bicycles, interventions focused on older riders and urban riding contexts may yield the greatest safety benefits. Regulatory oversight of e-bike equipment, particularly batteries and braking systems, remains critical to mitigate ignition, failure, and other hazards that differentiate e-bikes from traditional bicycles. Finally, integrating LLM-powered narrative analysis demonstrates a scalable approach for leveraging unstructured safety data, offering a replicable framework for other emerging modes of micromobility. \n- [31] J.
