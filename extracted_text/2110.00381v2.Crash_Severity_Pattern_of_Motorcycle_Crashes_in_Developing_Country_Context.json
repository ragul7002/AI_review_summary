  "abstract": "Despite paying special attention to the motorcycle-involved crashes in the safety research, little is \nknown about their pattern and impacts in developing countries. The widespread adoption of \nmotorcycles in such regions in tandem with the vulnerability of motorcyclists exacerbates the \nlikelihood of severe crashes. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the underlying \nfactors contributing to the severity of motorcycle-involved crashes through employing crash data \nfrom March 2018 to March 2019 from Iran. Considering the ordinal nature of three injury classes \nof property-damage-only (PDO), injury, and fatal crashes in our data, an ordered logistic regression \nmodel is employed to address the problem. The data statistics suggest that motorcycle is \nresponsible for 38% of injury and 15% of all fatal crashes in the dataset.",
  "introduction": "Due to lack of protective structure, motorcycles are one of the most vulnerable vehicles exposed \nto high injury and fatality risk. More than half of the road crash fatalities are among vulnerable \nroad users (i.e., motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists) (1). Moreover, per vehicle miles traveled \nin 2019 in the U.S., motorcyclists’ risk to be involved in a fatal or injury crash is 29 and 4 times \nmore than a car, respectively(2). \nThe severity of motorcycle-involved crashes in developing countries is also becoming a \nmajor concern, primarily for the growing use of motorcycles as an affordable transportation mode \n(3). For instance, the fraction of motorcycles to all motorized vehicles is 55% for Sri Lanka (per \ncapita income of $3,780) (1), while it is nearly 3% for the U.S.",

  "results": "indicate that \nsignificant factors contributing to more severe crashes include collision, road, temporal, and \nmotorcycle rider characteristics. Among all attributes, our model is most sensitive to the \nmotorcycle-pedestrian accident, which increases the probability of belonging a crash into injury \nand fatal crashes by 0.289 and 0.019, respectively. Moreover, we discovered a significant degree \nof correlation between young riders and riders without a license. Finally, upon the insights obtained \nfrom the results, we propose safety countermeasures, including 1) strict traffic rule enforcement \nupon riders and pedestrians, 2) educational programs, and 3) road-specific adjustment policies. \n \nKeywords: Crash Data, Motorcycle, Severity, Developing Countries, Ordered Logit Model \n\nAsgharpour, Javadinasr, Bayati, and Mohammadian \n2 \n \n1 INTRODUCTION \nDue to lack of protective structure, motorcycles are one of the most vulnerable vehicles exposed \nto high injury and fatality risk.",
  "discussion": "are presented in section 5. In section \n\nAsgharpour, Javadinasr, Bayati, and Mohammadian \n3 \n \n6, we elaborate on policy recommendations. Finally, the summary of the study is presented in \nsection 7. \n2 BACKGROUND \nThe severity of motorcycle-involved crashes has an extensive research background and \nconsiderable efforts have been made to explore the key influential factors in recent years. Among \ncollision characteristics, single and multi-vehicle motorcycle crashes are widely examined and \nfound to be significant (6–10).",
  "conclusion": "is in line with Pervez et al. (25). \nA paramount reason for this trend is the different number of motorcycle trips in various seasons. \nAccording to Table 3, nearly 60% of motorcycle-involved crashes have occurred in warm seasons. \nConcerning the time-of-day attribute, night and dawn/dusk time intervals negatively affect \ninjury severity.",
