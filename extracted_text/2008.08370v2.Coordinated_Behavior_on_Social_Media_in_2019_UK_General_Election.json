  "abstract": "Coordinated online behaviors are an essential part of infor-\nmation and inﬂuence operations, as they allow a more effec-\ntive disinformation’s spread. Most studies on coordinated be-\nhaviors involved manual investigations, and the few existing\ncomputational approaches make bold assumptions or over-\nsimplify the problem to make it tractable.\nHere, we propose a new network-based framework for un-\ncovering and studying coordinated behaviors on social media.\nOur research extends existing systems and goes beyond lim-\niting binary classiﬁcations of coordinated and uncoordinated\nbehaviors. It allows to expose different coordination patterns\nand to estimate the degree of coordination that characterizes\ndiverse communities. We apply our framework to a dataset\ncollected during the 2019 UK General Election, detecting and\ncharacterizing coordinated communities that participated in\nthe electoral debate. Our work conveys both theoretical and\npractical implications and provides more nuanced and ﬁne-\ngrained results for studying online information manipulation.",
  "introduction": "In recent years, information or inﬂuence operations (IOs)\nhave been frequently carried out on social media to mis-\nlead and manipulate. With this terminology, borrowed from\nthe military sphere, social media companies have designated\nthe attempts to spread deceptive content on their platforms,\norchestrated by state and non-state actors (Alassad, Spann,\nand Agarwal 2020; Weedon, Nuland, and Stamos 2017). IOs\ncan take different shapes, target various individuals, online\ncrowds, or communities, and have diverse goals (Starbird,\nArif, and Wilson 2019). Among the strategic tools used by\nperpetrators are fake news, propaganda, hateful speech, as-\ntroturﬁng, colluding users (e.g., paid trolls), and automation\n(e.g., social bots). Since the Donald Trump election and the\nBrexit referendum in 2016, each of these tools has attracted\nextensive scientiﬁc attention.",
  "related_work": "Due to the many existing challenges, to date, only a few\nworks have attempted to develop computational means\nto detect and characterize coordinated online behaviors.\nAmong them, the most similar approach to our present work\nis (Pacheco et al. 2020; Pacheco, Flammini, and Menczer\n2020). Such a work proposed to extract behavioral traces of\nonline activity and use them to build a bipartite network. To\ndo so, they projected the network onto the accounts, obtain-\ning a user similarity network. Then, they ﬁltered low-weight\nedges, and disconnected nodes, by applying a restrictive and\narbitrary similarity threshold.",
  "methodology": "for their\nanalysis represent open challenges. In particular, so far, no\nsuccessful attempt has been reported to distinguish between\nauthentic and inauthentic coordination automatically (Var-\ngas, Emami, and Traynor 2020). Instead, some researchers\nhave recently focused on the more straightforward task of\ndetecting and studying coordinated behaviors, disregarding\nintent and authenticity. To this end, the few existing tech-\nniques make simple assumptions, such as using ﬁxed thresh-\nolds to obtain a binary distinction between coordinated and\nuncoordinated behaviors (Pacheco et al. 2020).",

  "conclusion": "s\nWe addressed the problem of uncovering coordinated be-\nhaviors in social media. We proposed a new network-based\nframework and applied it for studying coordinated behaviors\nin the 2019 UK General Election (GE). Our work has both\ntheoretical and practical implications.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint of ﬁghting IOs and CIB,\nour framework goes beyond a binary deﬁnition of coordi-\nnated vs. uncoordinated behaviors, allowing the investiga-\ntion of the whole spectrum of coordination. We reached this\ngoal via an improved network ﬁltering and a coordination-\naware community detection process.",
