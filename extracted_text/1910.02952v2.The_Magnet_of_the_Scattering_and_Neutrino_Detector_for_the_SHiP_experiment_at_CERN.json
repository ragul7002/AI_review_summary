In several cases, the present experimental\nand theoretical constraints from cosmology and astrophysics indicate that a large fraction of the\ninteresting parameter space was beyond the reach of previous searches, but it is open and accessible\nto current and future facilities. While the mass range up to the kaon mass has been the subject of\nintensive searches, the bounds on the interaction strength of long-lived particles above this scale\nare signiﬁcantly weaker. The recently proposed Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) beam-dump\nexperiment [2] at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerator is designed to both search\nfor decay signatures by full reconstruction and particle identiﬁcation of SM ﬁnal states and to\n– 1 –\n\nsearch for scattering signatures of Light Dark Matter by the detection of recoil of atomic electrons\nor nuclei.\nThe Beam Dump Facility (BDF) where SHiP operates is well described in ref. [3]: the\nmost upstream BDF part is a proton target followed by a 5 m long hadron absorber. In addition\nto absorbing the hadrons and the electromagnetic radiation, the iron of the hadron absorber is\nmagnetised over a length of 4 m. Its dipole ﬁeld makes up the ﬁrst section of the active muon\nshield [4] which is optimised to sweep out of acceptance muons of the entire momentum spectrum,\nup to 350 GeV/c. The remaining part of the muon shield follows immediately downstream of the\nhadron absorber in the experimental "
