  "introduction": "T HE trend towards the wide use of mobile phones as a must-have company, draws the attention of manufacturers and developers to enhance the capabilities of these devices and \nDr. Amir Rajabzadeh is with Razi University, Computer Engineering Faculty, Bagh-e-Abrisham, Iran, Kermanshah (Mobile: +989123473189; Tel/Fax: +988314283265; e-mail: rajabzadeh@razi.ac.ir). \nAli Reza Manashty is with Razi University, Computer Engineering Faculty, Bagh-e-Abrisham, Iran, Kermanshah (Corresponding author) (Mobile:+989355332577; fax: +988318359105; e-mail: a.r.manashty@gmail.com) \nZahra Forootan Jahromi is with Razi University, Computer Engineering Faculty, Bagh-e-Abrisham, Iran, Kermanshah (Mobile: +989177922901; e-mail: zahra.forootan@gmail.com) \nMohammad Reza Ahmadzadeh Raji is with Razi University, Computer Engineering Faculty, Iran, Kermanshah e-mail: moh853@gmail.com) \nbring more functions and facilities from PCs and other regular devices to mobile phones. \nMost of the current cell phones are also a good digital camera, a MP3/MP4 player, a web browser and a game console. Although various types of application have been written for these devices, there’s still a huge difference between the capabilities of the PC applications and the Mobile ones. This difference is caused by the lack of processing capabilities and the libraries written for these devices. \nThere are various platforms and mobile operating systems currently available for mobile phones, such as Java, Symbian OS and Windows Mobile. Java supported platforms are becoming more common, as in recent Symbian OS based handsets, J2ME applications are also supported as a side platform. One of the most promising software platforms for mobile devices is Java 2 Micro Edition. Sun representatives asserted that 18 to 20 million mobile phones support the J2ME platform (in the year 2003) and analysts prediction that within the next few years, this technology will become omnipresent, and Gartner Group estimates that, in 2006, approximately 80 percent of mobile phones will support Java [1], has become a reality. The low-level programming and compatibility problems of the J2ME, along with UI (user interface) designing difficulties, make it hard for most programmers to develop applications for this platform. One distinguishable attempt to enhance the UI and the utility libraries of the J2ME platform for the _programmers_ is J2ME Polish [2]. Despite major utilities a programmer can use to make his/her job easier in J2ME programming by using J2ME Polish, there are still difficulties using this tool (e.g., IDE integration). Although a book has been published about J2ME Polish [3], but there are still problems using it that makes it double hard for developers to adopt either base J2ME platform libraries or the libraries and UI presented in J2ME Polish. \nNowadays people spend a notable amount of time in transportation, without having access to their PCs or having hard time accessing their labtops; instead, they are constantly using their cell-phones/PDAs. Because of this, many companies and active advertisement centers, whether religious, educational or business related are pinpointing on these handset devices for applying their policies. Despite of this huge trend, there is still a lack of programmers that write both \n62 \nWorld Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 62 2010 \nvisually and functionally acceptable mobile applications in beneficial time and cost. Some people worked on the importance of the GUI [4] while others focused on the commercial and educational importance of mobile applications [5], [6], [7], [8] _**.**_ Still there is no common tool for users to create their desired mobile-based content that can be used by a wide variety of people during their daily life. \nIn web-based services, the term CMS (Content Management System) is used to describe a web application that gives content-oriented accessability to the administrator of the website, regardless of his/her knowledge in programming concepts of the website. In addition to content-oriented access, the administrator can also change the visual theme of his/her website. Joomla [9] and Wordpress [10] CMSs are opensource samples of so called website applications. In PC applications scope, there are lots of programs that help users create multimedia applications without any need of software designing challenges. Now that mobile devices are undetachable part of everybody’s routine; there is still a need for mobile content creation tools so that the providers of contents can publish their data (whether rich-content data or simple texts) through structured theme-based applications that can also provide some facilities for using mobile device special capabilities (e.g., sending contents through SMS/MMS or media playback; that using mobile browsers for these jobs is still facing some difficuties). In this paper, we’ll present a solution for a simplified approach toward content-oriented mobile application designing.",
  "conclusion": "In this paper we presented a content management system for mobile devices that support the J2ME platform. The unique idea of the ARMrayan MCMS is its content-oriented structure which grants the user full control over the content he/she may want to share and still without the need of writing even a line of mid level J2ME language code. The design of the mobile engine as a core and the insertion of the user’s data within a template file is the main key of this solution. Features like the ability to write in Middle Eastern languages like Farsi and Arabic and the ability to change the fonts are amongst the unique abilities that make this content management system novel. Above all the features of the software, the idea to bring together the popular multimedia contents in the mobile phone applications is of the highest importance, something that we believe is necessary in the current decade. \nIn the first month of developing this system, we awarded the 1st Place in the 3rd International Digital Media Festival as the “The Best Mobile Software in Technology, Innovation and Development” for “ARMrayan Mobile CMS”; Iran-Tehran; October 2009 [11]. Not many days passed, that an output of the program which contained audio and photo gallery, multilanguage text and fabulous design, also awarded the 3[rd] Place in the 4[th] National Imam-Reza Festival, Professional Mobile \nSoftware Title of the Digital Media section, for the “Imam Reza Pilgrim Mobile Software”; Iran-Tehran; December 2009 [12]. We also sponsored by a high cultural and religion center for upgrading the application with their desired need, so that they can produce multi-language cultural and religious content-oriented mobile application for broadcasting into the society."
