  "abstract": "operator theoretic con-\ntext for reﬂection positivity that we feel should be developed further (Section 2.6;\n[JR07, An13, AFG86, Di04]). In probabilistic contexts, one encounters situations\nsatisfying the Markov condition, i.e., there exists a subspace E0 ⊆E+ mapped iso-\nmetrically onto bE (Section 2.3).\nThe connection between reﬂection positive Hilbert spaces and representation the-\nory is introduced in Chapter 4. After discussing some general properties of the OS\ntransform, we introduce symmetric Lie groups (G,τ), symmetric subsemigroups\nS ⊆G and various kinds of reﬂection positivity conditions for unitary represen-\ntations. As in the representation theory of operator algebras, where cyclic repre-\nsentations are generated from states, it is an extremely fruitful approach to gen-\nerate representations of groups and semigroups by positive deﬁnite functions via\nthe Gelfand–Naimark–Segal (GNS) construction. Here reﬂection positivity require-\nments lead to the concept of a reﬂection positive function whose values may also\ncomprise bounded operators or bilinear forms (Section 3.4).\nAfter these generalities, we turn in Chapter 4 to the most elementary concrete\nsymmetric Lie group (G,τ) = (R,−idR), where the RP condition is based on the\nsubsemigroup R+.",

  "discussion": "of the concrete examples, the reader should be prepared to\nappreciate the Lie theoretic aspects of the theory, which start in Chapter 6 with\nthe development of the integration techniques that are used to obtain a unitary rep-\nresentation of the simply connected Lie group Gc on bE from a reﬂection positive\nrepresentation of (G,τ) on (E ,E+,θ). Our techniques are based on the fact that the\nHilbert spaces are mostly constructed from G-invariant positive deﬁnite kernels or\npositive deﬁnite G-invariant distributions. We have already seen that any reﬂection\npositive representation of (G,τ) immediately yields a unitary representation Uc of\nH = Gτ\n0 on bE , so that it remains to ﬁnd a unitary representation of the one-parameter\ngroups expGc(Rix) for x ∈q. By Stone’s Theorem, the main point is to show that, for\ny ∈q, the symmetric operator c\ndU(y) deﬁned on a dense subspace of bE is essentially\nselfadjoint. In our geometric setting, this can be derived from Fr¨ohlich’s Theorem\n[Fro80] which provides a criterion for the essential selfadjointness of a symmetric\noperator in terms of the existence of enough local solutions of the corresponding\nlinear ODE.",
