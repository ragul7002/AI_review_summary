This programme is only\nindicative, and the actual investigations will respond to our experimental results and\nassociated theoretical developments.\nFor performing the CLOUD investigations we propose (Figs. 1 and 2) to combine\na novel expansion cloud chamber with a reactor chamber and associated experimental\nsystems for gas and particle analysis. Reasons for designating CLOUD as CERN’s Atmo-\nspheric Research Facility are as follows:\n• The concept of a facility is appropriate for the comparatively large and complex\nexperimental programme of CLOUD.\n• CLOUD is a ‘general purpose’ detector. Flexibility is required because we do not\nknow what we shall discover or where rapid experimental and theoretical develop-\nments may lead us.\n• No such facility is presently available to atmospheric scientists at any other location\nworldwide.\n• A time span for the experiments of several years is envisaged.\n• Our team already includes atmospheric scientists from 10 institutes in 5 countries\nbut we can expect others to propose experiments when they know of the existence\nof the facility and its unrivalled capabilities.\n\n\nPerspective view of the proposed CERN Atmospheric Research Facility,\nCLOUD.\n\n\n\nWhy at CERN?",

Theoretical studies and direct observations\nof ion eﬀects from aircraft and balloons give important clues, but adequate laboratory\nfacilities to investigate the microphysics under controlled conditions on the ground do not\nyet exist.\nThe experimental concept of CLOUD begins with studies of the various microphysical\nprocesses by which cosmic rays may aﬀect cloud formation in the atmosphere.",
  "conclusion": "s\nii\n\n1\nIntroduction\n1.1\nOverview\nAt its meeting on 6 September 2000, the SPSC suggested that CLOUD [1, 2] should be\nconsidered as a facility rather than a single experiment. We welcome this suggestion, which\ncorresponds with earlier informal discussions that we had with CERN management. This\ndocument therefore places CLOUD in the framework of a CERN facility for atmospheric\nresearch.\nIt also addresses some questions raised by the SPSC at the same meeting,\nconcerning the use of a CERN PS beam.\n1.2\nAn Atmospheric Research Facility at CERN\nClouds are the familiar but complex engines of the world’s weather and climate.
