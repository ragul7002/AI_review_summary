  "abstract": ". As the amount of personal information stored at remote service providers increases, so does\nthe danger of data theft. When connections to remote services are made in the clear and authenticated\nsessions are kept using HTTP cookies, data theft becomes extremely easy to achieve. In this paper, we\nstudy the architecture of the world’s largest service provider, i.e., Google. First, with the exception of\na few services that can only be accessed over HTTPS (e.g., Gmail), we ﬁnd that many Google services\nare still vulnerable to simple session hijacking.",
  "introduction": "With the emergence of cloud-based computing, users store an increasing amount of information at remote\nservice providers. User proﬁling techniques can complement such information automatically. Cloud-based\nservices often come at no cost for the users, while service providers leverage considerable amounts of user\nproﬁling information to deliver targeted advertisement. Such a business model appears to beneﬁt all par-\nties. However, storing large amounts of personal information to external providers raises privacy concerns.\nPrivacy advocates have highlighted the conceptual and practical dangers of personal data exposure over the\nInternet [12,13,14,15].\nIn this paper, we analyze private information potentially leaked from web searches to third parties, rather\nthan focusing on data disclosed to service providers.\nThe case of Google Web History.",

After an incoming HTTP request, a server sends back a HTTP\nresponse containing an HTTP header, referred to as Set-Cookie, requesting the browser to store one or several\ncookies. Such a header is in the form of name=value, the so-called “cookie crumb”. As a result, provided\nthat the user agent enables cookies, every subsequent HTTP request to a server on the same domain will\ninclude the cookie in the Cookie HTTP header. A cookie may also include an expiration date3, or a ﬂag to\nmark it secure."
