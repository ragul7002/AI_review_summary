  "abstract": "This paper compares networks of foreign fighters who joined the Islamic State of Iraq\nand Syria (ISIS) from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula in order to test whether there\nare differences in their recruitment and how those differences affect the nature of the\nforeign fighter mobilization. It is the first study to compare different networks of\nforeign fighters that joined the same group in the same conflict at the same period of\ntime.\nThis study finds that foreign fighter recruitment resembles an efficiency-secrecy\ntradeoff: in places where recruitment needs to be hidden from legal scrutiny,\nrecruitment networks are decentralized; composed of small and more local\nrecruitment cells. These cells can operate more secretly and the group as a whole is\nmore resilient to disruption. In exchange, it is hard for the group to attract large\nnumbers of recruits. Whereas in places where recruitment could occur more freely,\nrecruitment networks are more hierarchical; comprised of a larger number of recruits\nwith more geographically diverse connections. The hierarchical design of their\nrecruitment networks may be easier to disrupt, but it also helps the group efficiently\nrecruit more followers if left undisturbed. This study concludes that the ISIS foreign\nfighter recruitment process varied significantly. Researchers and policymakers focused",

The more secrecy was required in recruitment, the more\nlikely recruits would have fewer ties, more local ties, and the structure of their network would be\ndecentralized. This study concludes that a fighters’ geographic origin – country or province – is\nthe single most significant attribute predicting ties with other fighters. It is a better predictor than\n5 The Arabian Peninsula states include: Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, and\nSaudi Arabia. Europe includes all participants in the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, and Balkan states.\n3\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nany other individual-level variable (e.g., marital status, age, profession, or previous fighting\nexperience) in determining whether two fighters know each other.\nOn the one hand, this seems like a fairly obvious finding – of course it is more likely that\na fighter from Belgium will be connected to other Belgians than he would be to someone from\nSaudi Arabia. The finding is more useful when framed in _comparative terms_ : the question at the\nheart of this study is not whether Belgians are more likely to be connected to other Belgians, but\n_how much more likely_ are Belgians connected to other Belgians than Saudis are to other Saudis?\nThis paper finds that the predictive strength of geographic origins on tie formation\nbetween ISIS foreign fighters varies considerably depending on where a foreign fighter is\noriginally from. It finds that geography is far more predictive of a tie between fighters from\nEurope than for those from the Arabian Peninsula. In Europe, fighters who shared a country of\norigin were about 11 times more likely to share a tie than fighters who shared a country of origin\nin the Arabian Peninsula. Fighters who shared a province level tie in a European country were\nabout five times more likely to be connected to each other than fighters who came from a\ncountry in the Arabian Peninsula. That means there was a far greater restriction to the geography\nof ties among fighters in Europe than of those from the Arabian Peninsula.\nI believe the reason why the networks of fighters from the Arabian Peninsula were\nlarger, stronger, more hierarchical, and more geographically dispersed than those from Europe is\nbecause of how free they were to self-organize and mobilize. Anyone interested in joining ISIS\nfrom the Arabian Peninsula could meet like-minded individuals in any other country or province\nin the region, virtually unimpeded. [6] However, in Europe, there were steeper barriers to\ntransnational ties. This included pervasive social and legal opposition. [7] The scrutiny of Europe’s\n6 See, for example, Dickinson, Beth.

[8] They would prefer to develop organizational\ncharts, clear hierarchies and lines of communication. This would allow them to function more\nefficiently – the leaders of the group could issue orders and have clear mechanisms to monitor\nwhether those orders were being carried out. But, of course, this is rarely possible, so terrorist\ngroups design decentralized organizational structures to maximize secrecy and minimize the\neffect of disruption. In a decentralized network, getting rid of one cell or leader does not\ndismantle the whole group.\nBut Shapiro’s study focused on how a terrorist group behaves. This study appears to\nconfirm that there is a secrecy-efficiency tradeoff not just in terrorist operations, but also in\nterrorist group recruitment. This tradeoff is found in the _localism_ of the recruitment process. In\nthe Arabian Peninsula, prospective fighters were able to meet other like-minded individuals from\nacross the country without nearly as much scrutiny from law enforcement as in Europe. In\nEurope, prospective fighters were recruited with concerns for law enforcement. Therefore,\nfighters from Europe made fewer ties, and the connections they made were highly local.\nConsequently, their networks were also comprised of a smaller number of recruits.\nPrevious work on terrorist group recruitment has underscored the primacy of social\nnetworks. Julie Hwang found that social network ties were the most important dimension\nfacilitating the recruitment of Indonesian foreign fighters. [9] Marc Sageman studied 175 individuals\nwho joined Al Qaeda (AQ) and found that 75% of them joined with at least one other person. [10]\n8 Jacob N. Shapiro, _The Terrorist’s Dilemma: Managing Violent Covert Organizations_ (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University\nPress, 2013).\n9 Chernov Hwang, J. (2018), “Pathways into Terrorism: Joining Islamist Extremist Groups in Asia,” a special issue\nof _Terrorism and Political Violence_ .\n10 Marc Sageman, _Understanding Terror Networks_ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004).\n5\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nAnother multi-nation study concluded that 95% of AQ fighters were recruited by a friend or\nfamily member. [11] A study of Dutch foreign fighters from 2000-2013 found that “social\nfacilitators” were a key step in the transition from radicalization to mobilization. [12] In Turkey, a\nstudy of foreign fighters found that 96% of fighters cited “peer pressure,” and 75% cited\n“socialization with other foreign fighters” as part of their decision-making process to fight in\nSyria. [13] In Germany, Reynolds and Hafez study developed detailed profiles for 99 German\nforeign fighters, finding that “71 of the 99 profiles had a personal connection with at least one\nother German foreign fighter before departing Germany.” [14] The same is true in many other\ncontexts.\nThis past work emphasizes that networks matter in foreign fighter recruitment, but it\nlacks comparative context. Are some places more prone to extensive in-person recruitment than\nothers? To address this gap, this paper demonstrates empirically that the networks of foreign\nfighters vary considerably depending on what region they come from. It also narrows down the\nfactors that best explain these differences and what it means for how foreign fighters join an\ninsurgency. For the first time, we have data that can show us differences in how people can be\nrecruited for the same group in the same conflict at the same time but from different places.\nalso have some key similarities, in particular reasonably free trade and cross-border travel during\nthe time they were recruited, as well as historical, political, social and cultural similarities. I\nselected to compare regions, rather than specific countries, in order to avoid the possibility that\ndifferences discovered were a product of the specific conditions in those countries (although in\n**Generating and Analyzing Network Data**\nI constructed three different networks for each region, one for each of three different\nquestions on the leaked ISIS foreign fighter registration forms. First, ISIS fighters were asked to\nname the person who was their “Referral” ( _Tazkiyya_ ) – someone who could vouch for their\njihadist “credentials.” Second, they were asked to name the “Facilitator” ( _Wassita_ ) – someone\nwho helped smuggle them into ISIS territory. And third, the ISIS administrator noted the date\nand location of where the newly arrived fighter entered ISIS territory (“Date/Location”).\nFighters were connected to each other if they shared the same reference in common, the same\nfacilitator in common, and/or whether they arrived on the same day and at the same location.\nDefinitions for these three networks are provided below in Table 2 below. Fighters are “nodes”,\nthe factors determining connections between them are “edges.”\n9\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nTable 2 – Node-Edge Definitions for the Three Networks in This Study\n|Network #|Node|Edge|Network type|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Fighters|Referrals|Undirected,_weighted_ network in which fighters are<br>connected based on whether they mentioned the<br>same referral who recommended that they join.<br>The network is weighted when two fighters share<br>multiple referrals, although this is rare.|\n|2|Fighters|Facilitator|Undirected, unweighted network in which fighters<br>are connected based on whether they mentioned<br>the same facilitator who helped them reach ISIS<br>territory.|\n|3|Fighters|Date/Location<br>of Entry into<br>ISIS territory|Undirected, unweighted network in which fighters<br>are connected based on whether they were logged<br>as entering ISIS territory at the same time and<br>place.|\nAll three of the networks described above are “two-mode networks.” Two-mode\nnetworks are those that _infer_ ties based on some mutual connection, such as co-attendance at\nsocial gatherings or co-participation in a protest. [18] The strength of the inference of a tie between\ntwo people varies in two-mode networks: if two people attend a protest of 10,000 people, we are\nless likely to infer that they know one another than if they attended a meeting of 10 people.\nBesides size of an event they attend, another way to infer how strong a two-mode\nnetwork can predict ties between two nodes is if the network demonstrates certain homophily\nattributes. [19] For example, if the fighters are connected to each other and have nothing in\ncommon with one another, there may be some external force ordering their connections (i.e.,\nISIS recruiters). Or these networks only weakly model actual relationships between fighters (see\n“Limitations” in Section VI). In other words, if the networks in this study do not display any\nhomophily, we should be suspicious of our how accurately they model reality absent a\ncompelling explanation for some external ordering of the fighters’ ties.\n18 Stephen P. Borgatti, Martin G. Everett, and Jeffrey C. Johnson, _Analyzing social networks_ (London: SAGE\nPublications Limited, 2013).\n19 Ivan Brugere, Brian Gallagher, Tanya Y. Berger-Wolf, “Network Structure Inference, A Survey: Motivations,\nfreedom people had to self-organize and mobilize in each region. The more people shared a\nreferral, facilitator, and arrival date and location, the more likely they were to know each other\nand the easier it would be for them to travel together. For the purposes of brevity, I call these\nties “strong” ties between fighters.\nFigure 2– Strong Tie Networks – Europe and Arabian Peninsula\nTable 4 – Comparison of Strong-Tie Networks in Europe and Arabian Peninsula\n|Descriptive Statistic|Arabian Peninsula|Europe|\n|---|---|---|\n|Average Weighted Degree|5.0|5.0|\n|Connected Components|85|21|\n|Percent of Nodes w/ an Edge ≥ 3|19%|10%|\nTo analyze the strength of ties between fighters, I combined all three networks into one\nnetwork and weighted the edges 1-3 depending on how many answers each fighter with a tie\n16\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nshared in common. [25] I then restricted the networks to only show fighters who share a tie with an\nedge weight of at least three, and these are shown in Figure 2.\nAs shown in Table 4, the Arabian Peninsula has more than double the proportion of\nfighters who have strong-tie relationships than those from Europe. It also has four times the\nnumber of connected components, and a comparable average weighted degree. This suggests\nthat fighters from the Arabian Peninsula are not only more connected than those from Europe,\nbut also more “strongly” connected. This has analytical value: that the Arabian Peninsula\nnetwork has more “strong” ties means it was more likely fighters from there were able to\norganize openly and collectively. They could remain connected by their referral and also travel\ntogether to Syria via the same facilitator and arrive on the same day at the same place.\n**IV. What Predicts Whether Two Foreign Fighters “Know” Each Other?**\nWe now know that Arabian Peninsula foreign fighter networks were larger and more\nfreely forming. But what factors predict how they form? This section will compare ERGM\nEurope and the Arabian Peninsula. Second, it will test how strongly province-level origins\npredict ties among fighters from France and Saudi Arabia. This is to determine how the\ngeographic dispersion of fighters varies between countries in Europe and the Arabian Peninsula.\nERGMs are like regressions for network data. They help identify the attributes that are\nmost predictive of a tie between fighters. To describe these correlations, I use the Lusher et al\nbelow).\n**ERGMs of European and Arabian Peninsula Networks**\nIn the European sample, the reference and entry networks show a very strong positive\ncorrelation with regards to the country of origin, while the facilitator network shows few\nbelow). In the reference network, with all else being equal, fighters in the Europe sample were\nmore than 11 times more likely to share a tie if they were from the same country. This\nconnection is even stronger in the entry network, where fighters were 55 times more likely to\nshare a tie if they were from the same country. For the reference and entry networks among\nEuropean fighters, it appears that many attributes that might apply in normal conditions of\nhomophily – birth year, educational background, and previous jihad experience – are also\nstrongly indicative of shared ties. However, with the exception of religious knowledge, all of\nthese attributes decline in relevance for the entry network. Virtually no attribute indicates a\nshared tie in the facilitator network of the Europe sample, with the modest exception of the\ncountry of residence.\n|Col1|Reference Network|Col3|Facilitator Network|Col5|Entry Network|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Europe|Arab.

In the reference network,\ncountry of origin negatively predicts fighter ties (-0.38) and is only modestly positive in the\nfacilitator and entry networks (0.12 and 0.04 respectively). This means that, all else being equal, a\nfighter from Saudi Arabia is just as likely to share a tie with another Saudi as he is with, for\nexample, a fighter from Kuwait. Meanwhile, some personal attributes predict ties with statistical\nsignificance between fighters in more than one of the three networks, such as marital status and\neducational background.\n**ISIS Managing Europe Fighter Arrivals**\nfighters from Europe is that there appears to be a deliberate sorting of fighters from Europe.\nThis is likely done by ISIS recruiters, who appear to have arranged for fighters from certain\n19\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nin the previous findings: first, that few attributes predict ties in Europe’s facilitator network, and\nsecond, that the country of origin attribute so strongly predicts ties in Europe’s entry network\nthis network are likely organized by an external actor – in this case, it is likely to be the ISIS\nbureaucracy.\nFigure 3 – ISIS-Organized Arrivals for European Fighters\nThe facilitator is an ISIS operative who works out the logistics of foreign fighter entry\ninto ISIS territory. [27] Reporting has described how ISIS sometimes manages the process of fighter\narrivals, rather than letting the fighters plan the trip themselves. [28] Given this, it is likely that\nfacilitators managed the process of European ISIS joiners arriving in Syria and organized them\nby country of origin.\nbeing at least partially managed by ISIS officials in Syria. The reference network, meanwhile,\n27 Dodwell et al (see note 25 above).\n28 Alessandria Masi and Hanna Sender, “How Foreign Fighters Joining ISIS Travel to the Islamic State Group’s\n‘Caliphate’,” _IB Times_, March 3, 2015, http://www.ibtimes.com/how-foreign-fighters-joining-isis-travel-islamicstate-groups-caliphate-1833812 (accessed December 19, 2018).\n20\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nwhich shows the most amount of homophily, is likely still a network formed by fighters without\nbut do not change the fundamental differences between fighter networks from Europe and the\nArabian Peninsula.\nThe key finding of this research is that there are structural differences in the composition\nof the social networks of foreign fighters. Fighters from the Arabian Peninsula had more ties,\nmore strong ties, and their ties were more geographically dispersed than those from Europe. Yet\ndespite these differences, all fighters studied here joined the same organization in the same\nconflict at roughly the same time. It shows that the recruitment process for new joiners varied\nsignificantly within a single organization.\nFighters are more interconnected in the Arabian Peninsula than they are in Europe in\nterms of the number of ties, the strength of their ties, and the number of clusters of large ties. In\nEurope, the networks of recruits are more disparate and disconnected, suggesting that\nrecruitment is more likely to occur on a one-to-one basis than in the Arabian Peninsula, where\ninterconnected networks suggest a more social and interpersonal recruitment process.\nThere are several possible mechanisms that could explain the difference in networks\nbetween fighters from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula. One may be that the Muslim majority\nsocieties of the Arabian Peninsula simply offer greater opportunities for potential recruits to\nmeet each other: there are more mosques and preachers, and a larger proportion of state and\nprivate resources spent on religious activity.\nBut ethnographic research into European neighborhoods such as Molenbeek, one of the\nlargest Muslim communities in Brussels, might challenge this explanation. Fraihi, for example,\nfound high concentrations of potential recruits for radical Salafist movements among local youth\n21\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nalmost a decade before ISIS was formed. [29] Her finding suggests that while the absolute number\nof resources potential recruits could use to meet is greater in the Arabian Peninsula than in\nEurope, it may be that the concentration of such resources (i.e., in neighborhoods like\nMolenbeek) is actually greater. As such, this explanation is likely incomplete.\nA second reason for the differences in connectivity between fighters from Europe or the\nArabian Peninsula may be shared language. Although most residents of Europe can travel freely\nthrough its Schengen Area, residents of its different countries speak different languages. This\nmight constitute a barrier to the opportunities that, for example, a person living in France might\nface to meeting someone from Germany. These same barriers do not apply in the Arabian\nPeninsula, where the shared language is Arabic.\nshow that the do not share transnational ties with fighters who might share their language abroad\n(i.e., Moroccan residents in Belgium are unlikely to share a tie with Moroccans from Morocco).\nIf language determined tie formation between ISIS foreign fighters, we would expect there to be\nmany more ties between Moroccan fighters living in Europe and Moroccan fighters who travel\nFirst, the network of fighters from the Arabian Peninsula was larger, more hierarchical, and more\ngeographically dispersed than those from Europe. Whereas the network of European foreign\nfighters was smaller, more geographically constrained inside their country of origin, and more\ndecentralized in terms of their network structure. In addition, ISIS may have deliberately\nmanaged European foreign fighters to arrive by their country of origin, another factor\nhighlighting their greater concern for security.\nSecond, the most likely explanation for these network differences are due to the different\ncontexts in which recruitment occurred. The law enforcement scrutiny in Europe meant that\n31 Enders and Su (see note 32 above); Frederic S. Pearson, Isil Akbulut & Marie Olson Lounsbery (2017) Group\nStructure and Intergroup Relations in Global Terror Networks: Further Explorations, Terrorism and Political\nViolence, 29:3, 550-572, DOI: 10.1080/09546553.2015.1058788\n25\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nnetworks of fighters were smaller, more local, and more decentralized. This localism was a way\nto maintain the secrecy of the fighters’ identities and intentions. Meanwhile, networks were\nlarger, geographically dispersed, and hierarchical in the Arabian Peninsula, where recruitment\noccurred more freely. Alternative explanations, such as cultural or linguistic differences, are\nconsidered and rejected in the paper.\nThird, the ISIS foreign fighter recruitment process varied significantly. It would be a mistake to\ntreat ISIS as a homogenous group whose fighters share similar recruitment pathways.\nResearchers who study recruitment and radicalization should carefully frame their findings in\nterms of the social, political, and legal contexts in which their research takes place.\nFourth, European recruits were more isolated than those from the Arabian Peninsula, but it is\nunlikely they joined ISIS on their own. Yet one-on-one recruitment at such a large scale is\nunlikely to be carried out in person and more likely mediated online. This theory is worth testing\nin the future: whether the smaller, weaker fighter networks from Europeans meant that they\nwere more likely recruited online than those in the Arabian Peninsula.\nFifth, the extent of the networks shows that offline/online recruitment likely plays a greater role\non smaller networks with a larger proportion of isolated nodes. In Europe, Reynolds and Hafez\nfound less than 5% of German fighters in their study were confirmed to have been radicalized\nonline. [32] But Kennedy and Weimann emphasize the myriad uses insurgents might have to recruit\non the Internet. As the authors write, their goal is “not so much to assess the merits of the\nInternet as a replacement for physical interaction, but rather to demonstrate how terrorists utilize\nthe Internet” to build connections to potential recruits. [33] In light of this argument, it might be\n32 Reynolds and Hafez (see note 20 above)\n33 Jonathan Kennedy and Gabriel Weimann, “The Strength of Weak Terrorist Ties,” _Terrorism and Political Violence_ 23\nno. 2 (2011): 201-212, DOI: 10.1080/09546553.2010.521087, p. 207.\n26\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nmore useful to think about the two influences – in person and online – as complements rather\nthan substitutes. Some fighters are exclusively recruited in person, while others might be\nexclusively recruited online. More often, it is a combination of the two working in tandem. The\nfact that Europe’s fighters appear more disconnected in comparison to those from the Arabian\nPeninsula suggests that the recruitment process there was more frequently one-on-one. And\ngiven the scale and speed of ISIS recruitment, it is likely that much more of this one-on-one\nrecruitment was mediated through the Internet. Those isolates from Europe may not have\nexclusively used to Internet for their mobilization, but they may have been more likely to rely on\nthe Internet than the ones who were more interconnected to other joiners.\n**Limitations of the Study**\nThis study has three key limitations. First, the study relies on self-reported personal\ninformation to a terrorist organization. The foreign fighters analyzed in this study were less likely\nto lie than if they were interviewed by a journalist or, possibly, law enforcement, but there is\nlikely some information that a recruit withheld purposively (e.g., due to secrecy) or accidentally\n(e.g., due to language barriers). In generating this network data, a subject that offers the name of\nthree references is more likely to share a tie with other fighters than one who submits no name at\nall. Therefore, it is entirely possible that some of the most interconnected nodes in the network\ndiagrams are simply the people who provided the most detailed information in their form.\nImportant connections in the network may not have been captured because of incomplete or\ninaccurate responses.\nSecond, the two-mode networks analyzed in this study likely have varied degrees of\naccuracy in terms of their predicting actual relationships between fighters. Unlike the detailed\nreport on German foreign fighters by Reynolds and Hafez, this paper does not have details on\n27\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nhow these ties formed. [34] We do not know, for example, how many ties formed based on shared\ninterest in joining ISIS or whether they were pre-existing friendships or familial ties. Two-mode\nnetworks infer ties, and for reference networks, the relative homophily of the attributes inferring\nties between fighters, and information about the reference himself, suggests that this network is\nthe most predictive of an actual shared tie between two fighters in the study. That many\nreferences are likely local to the context from which the fighter originates means that they are\nlikely to be personally known in some capacity by both fighters. The properties of triadic closure\nthat underpin the assumptions of two-mode networks – that if node A and node B both know\nnode C very well, then they are eventually likely to know each other as well – are strong in the\nreference network case. [35] This is hardly evident in the facilitator network, and only slightly\nevident in the arrival network.\nThird, one of the most significant challenges in carrying out this research was reconciling\nthe myriad inconsistencies with which answers were recorded in the forms. These inconsistencies\nwere mostly minor and required careful hand coding to ensure accuracy. But inconsistencies\nwere sometimes more complicated, such as the transcription of people’s names. Some recruits\nreported their facilitator or reference by his real name, others by his _kunia_ (nom-de-guerre). And\nsome well-known fighters have many different kunias, such as Omar al-Shishani, a senior ISIS\ncommander who was known by at least 13 different names. [36] I reconciled these different\nreference names for some people in the data, but likely not all. Therefore, it is possible that the\nnetworks involving shared reference to an individual (e.g., the facilitator and reference networks)\nunderestimate the total number of links between fighters, although this effect is unlikely to be\nbiased against one country or region.\n34 Reynolds and Hafez (see note 20 above)\n35 Borgatti et al (see note 27 above)\n36 Author Unknown, “Wanted: Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili,” _U.S. Department of State – Rewards for Justice,_\n2016,\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160311070758/https://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/tarkhan_batirashvili.ht\nml (accessed January 4, 2019).\n28\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\n**Policy Recommendations**\nTwo policy recommendations flow from these findings – one clear and the other more\nsubtle. The clear finding of this research is that there are structural differences in the\ncomposition of social networks of people who join terrorist organizations from different regions.\nThis is demonstrated in the fact that fighters from the Arabian Peninsula are different than\nfighters from Europe in the breadth, depth, and dispersion of their ties, even though they joined\nthe same organization at roughly the same time. The implications of this are profound: that even\nwithin a single organization, the recruitment process for new joiners varies significantly. It would\ntherefore be a mistake to treat ISIS as a homogenous group whose fighters share similar\nrecruitment pathways. Research and policy on focused on the recruitment and radicalization of\nfighters to ISIS in particular, and transnational terrorist groups in general, should carefully frame\ntheir approach in terms of the social, political, and legal contexts in which their research or\npolicy takes place. Given the fundamentally different recruitment processes experienced by\nfighters from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula, contextualizing their origins is essential.\nThe second finding is more subtle: just as terrorist groups face a secrecy-efficiency\ntradeoff in their operations and in their recruitment, counterterrorism efforts also face efficiency\ntradeoffs in fighting the group.\nFigure 5 – Notional Hierarchical and Decentralized Networks\nPolicy: Control the\nkey node(s), control\nmost of the\nnetwork\nPolicy: Hard to\nundermine the entire\nnetwork; need to\naddress each cell\nHierarchical Network of Recruits Decentralized Network of Recruits\nThe group with the larger, more hierarchical recruitment structure shown in Figure 5 is\neasier to control. Control the nodes in the network with the most influence, and one can control\n29\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nthe entire network. But the risk with these types of networks is they pose a larger, more systemic\nthreat and are likely to emerge in places with weaker counterterrorism infrastructure. In such\nplaces, the policy is generally to find ways to control the key nodes in the network. This is the\nmost efficient way of addressing the threat with limited counterterrorism resources, because it\ninvolves the least amount of effort (i.e., finding ways of dissuading key individuals from\nthreatening the state) for the desired outcome (i.e., minimizing the terrorist threat). The problem\nwith this approach is that losing control of these nodes creates a significant threat. A good real\nworld example of this type of model is the network of ISIS supporters in Mosul in 2014: in July,\nseemingly overnight, these networks were activated, and they overwhelmed Iraqi security forces\n_en route_ to ISIS capturing the city. [37]\nInstead, bilateral and multilateral efforts should be made to help states that face system\nwide risks of terrorist groups push these groups to operate in secret. In doing so, they force\nthese groups to recruit on the secrecy side of the secrecy-efficiency spectrum, which means small\ncells recruiting fewer followers and only in certain key locations. This is a good outcome because\nit reduces the potential size of a terrorist group’s followers. But if this transformation, which\ncomes at a high cost, indeed occurs, it creates a new risk. Instead of threatening the state’s\ncontrol of a certain city or region, decentralized terrorist group cells that are resilient to\ndisruption pose the threat of one-off attacks that can still have a significant impact (i.e., ISIS\nattacks from 2015-20 that occurred in European cities like Paris, London, Berlin, and\nBarcelona). Efforts to help states transform their threat from an efficient and hierarchical one\nto a decentralized and resilient threat of one-off attacks must transform their counterterrorism\nefforts to identify this transformation and respond to the evolving threat.\n37 Yasir Abbas and Dan Trombly, “Inside the Collapse of the Iraqi Army’s 2nd Division,” _War on the Rocks,_ July 1,\n2014.\n30\n**Appendix I – Question Form**\n**اﻹدارة**\n#### **اﻟرﺣﯾم اﻟرﺣﻣن ﷲ ﺑﺳم**\n**اﻟﻌﺎﻣﺔ**\n#### **واﻟﺷﺎم اﻟﻌراق ﻓﻲ اﻹﺳﻼﻣﯾﺔ اﻟدوﻟﺔ**\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\n**ﻟﻠﺣدود**\n#### **ﻟﻠﺣدود اﻟﻌﺎﻣﺔ اﻹدارة**\n|ﻣﺟﺎھد|ﺑﯾﺎﻧﺎت|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||**      واﻟﻠﻘب اﻹﺳم**|**1 **|\n||** اﻟﻛﻧﯾﺔ**|**2**|\n||**اﻷم إﺳم**|**3**|\n||**اﻟدم ﻓﺻﯾﻠﺔ**|**4**|\n||**اﻟﺟﻧﺳﯾﺔ و اﻟوﻻدة ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ**|**5**|\n|** أﻋزب)**<br>**1**<br>** (**<br>** ﻣﺗزوج ( )**<br>** اﻷطﻔﺎل ﻋدد( )**|**اﻹﺟﺗﻣﺎﻋﯾﺔ اﻟﺣﺎﻟﺔ**|**6**|\n||** اﻹﻗﺎﻣﺔ ﻣﻛﺎن و اﻟﻌﻧوان**|**7**|\n||**اﻟدراﺳﻲ اﻟﺗﺣﺻﯾل**|**8**|\n|**  ﻋﻠم طﺎﻟب  ( )**<br>** ﻣﺗوﺳط ( )**<br>** ﺑﺳﯾط)**<br>**1**<br>** (**|** اﻟﺷرﻋﻲ اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى**|**9**|\n||**؟ اﻟﻣﺟﯾﺊ ﻗﺑل ﻣﮭﻧﺗك ﻣﺎھﻲ**|**1**<br>**0**|\n||**ﺑﮭﺎ؟ ﻟﺑﺛت وﻛم إﻟﯾﮭﺎ ﺳﺎﻓرت اﻟﺗﻲ اﻟﺑﻠدان**|**1**<br>**1**|\n|**ﺗل\tاﺑﯾض**|**؟ واﻟواﺳطﺔ ؟ ﻣﻧﮫ دﺧﻠت اﻟذي اﻟﻣﻧﻔذ**|**1**<br>**2**|\n||**؟ ﻣن وﻣن ﺗزﻛﯾﺔ ﻟدﯾك ھل**|**1**<br>**3**|\n||** ؟ اﻟدﺧول ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ**|**1**<br>**4**|\n||**؟ وأﯾن ؟ اﻟﺟﮭﺎد ﻟك ﺳﺑق ھل**|**1**<br>**5**|\n||**؟ إﻧﻐﻣﺎﺳﻲ أم إﺳﺗﺷﮭﺎدي أم ﻣﻘﺎﺗل**|**1**<br>**6**|\n|** ﻣﻘﺎﺗل ( )**<br>** ﺷرﻋﻲ ( )**<br>** أﻣﻧﻲ ( )**<br>** إداري ( )**|**؟ اﻹﺧﺗﺻﺎص**|**1**<br>**7**|\n||** اﻟﺣﺎﻟﻲ اﻟﻌﻣل ﻣﻛﺎن**|**1**<br>**8**|\n|**ﺳﻔر ﺟواز**|**؟ ﺗرﻛﺗﮭﺎ اﻟﺗﻲ اﻷﻣﺎﻧﺎت**|**1**<br>**9**|\n||**؟ واﻟطﺎﻋﺔ اﻟﺳﻣﻊ ﻣﺳﺗوى**|**2**<br>**0**|\n||**؟ ﻣﻌﮫ ﻧﺗواﺻل اﻟذي اﻟﻌﻧوان**|**2**<br>**1**|\n||** اﻟﻣﻛﺎن و اﻟﻘﺗل ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ**|**2**<br>**2**|\n||**ﻣﻼﺣﺿﺎت\tاﻻﻧﺗﻣﺎءات\tواﻟﺣﯾﺎة\tاﻟﻌﺎﻣﺔ\tواﻻﻋﺗﻘﺎﻻت\tوﻣطﻠوب\tام\tﻻ** <br>|**2**<br>**3**|\n**اﻟﺣدود اﻟﻌﺎﻣﺔ اﻹدارة**\n_**_**_ **ﺳﺮي** _**_**_ **واﻟﺸﺎماﻟﻌﺮاقﻓﻲاﻹﺳﻼﻣﯿﺔاﻟﺪوﻟﺔ**\n31\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\n**Appendix II – Question Form Translated**\nEach form contained the following fields:\n1.

and their chosen _nom de guerre_ (which\nare not unique but could be used to identify the individual) with an ID number. I also re-coded home\naddresses (if provided) from specific locations to the largest, subnational geographic region (i.e., states or\nprovinces). Finally, edge data such as the names of references or facilitators only appear as numbers in my\nadjacency matrices. Therefore, personally identifiable information about these individuals is also removed.\n**How the Data Were Obtained**\nIndividual consent was not obtained from the individuals and cannot be obtained from these individuals\nbecause they have joined a terrorist group. Instead, the individuals have been anonymized as described\nabove.\nIn early 2016, an ISIS fighter defected with personnel records containing detailed registration forms\nrecorded by ISIS border officials who interviewed over 3,500 newly arrived foreign recruits from 2013\n2014. I was given these forms by a Syrian journalist in the spring of 2016. I verified the validity of these\ndata by cross-referencing personal data in the registration files against research that I had overseen which\nuncovered the identities of ISIS fighters whose names were not public. I also verifying that my findings\nwere consistent with other studies that had used the same dataset (e.g., Dodwell et al, 2016). Several other\norganizations also have copies of this same dataset, and I have discussed these data with them, including\nresearchers at West Point Counter-Terrorism Center, George Washington University and the Royal United\nServices Institute (RUSI), based in London.\n35\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\n**Appendix VI - ERGMs of France and Saudi Networks to Assess Provincial-Level**\n**Ties**\nSaudi Arabia and France were chosen for the province-level analysis because they were\nthe countries with the largest number of fighters in their respective regions (Saudi Arabia n=755,\nand France n=108).

In the reference network,\nfighters from the same province in France were over eight times as likely to share a tie. Whereas\nin the facilitator network, fighters were less likely to share ties if they were from the same\nprovince than if they were from the same country, possibly due to a deliberate sorting of\nEuropean fighters based on their country of origin (see “ISIS Managing Fighter Arrivals” below).\nIn the facilitator network, the predictive effects of subnational-level residence for France were\nslightly stronger: a fighter was 1.3 times more likely to share a tie with another fighter from the\nsame country while 1.7 times more likely to share a tie with another fighter if they were from the\nsame province.\nThere are several other attributes in the network from France that also predict ties\nbetween fighters. Nationality is a strong predictor of ties in the reference network, but the effect\nis negative in the facilitator network and negligible in the entry network. Those who claim\nFrench residence and previous jihad experience are more likely to share a tie in the reference\nnetwork than any other attribute, including province of origin.\nOn the other hand, fighters from Saudi Arabia were more likely to know each other if\nthey were from the same province than any other attribute. That fighters from Saudi Arabia were\nmore likely to know someone from their province and almost equally likely to be connected to a\nforeigner at the country level suggests a widespread and grassroots mobilization network.\n37",
  "introduction": "**A** **THEORY OF LOCALISM AS SECRECY ............................................................................................................... 3**\nTwo years into the Syrian civil war, in the spring of 2013, a group of militant\ncommanders met for five days in a village called Kafr Hamra on the outskirts of the city of\nAleppo, Syria. Over grilled chicken, french fries and tea, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then\ncommander of the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq, tried to persuade his audience to help\nhim create a physical Islamic state. He argued that borders, citizens, institutions, and a\nfunctioning bureaucracy would offer a home to Muslims from all over the world. Unlike the\nelusive Al Qaeda (AQ), he explained, a formal state would attract recruits from among ordinary\nMuslims who might otherwise not know how to join. [1] In April 2013, weeks later, he announced\nthe group, once called the Islamic State of Iraq, would be rebranded into the Islamic State of\nIraq and Syria (ISIS). [2]\nAl-Baghdadi’s prediction about the allure of an Islamic state for new recruits proved\nprescient. Estimates of ISIS’ foreign fighters describe the group as having at least 40,000 fighters\nfrom over 100 countries foreign to Iraq and Syria. [3] This was not only by far the largest\nmobilization of foreign fighters for any insurgent group in the Syrian war, it was perhaps the\nlargest mobilization of foreign fighters to any conflict since at least the Spanish Civil War.

The hypothesis is that geographic\norigin is the strongest predictor of ties between fighters (‘Attribute 1’ in Table 1). The other\nattributes are mainly listed above as “controls,” – which means we can say how much geographic\norigin mattered for foreign fighters from one region over another regardless of a fighters’ age,\nmarital status, professional and educational backgrounds, etc. These other variables also help us\nunderstand how naturally forming the networks of foreign fighters are based on the theory of\n“homophily.” [17] Homophily simply states that, absent other influences, people tend to connect\nwith others who share similar backgrounds. In this case, if a fighters’ age, marital status,\neducational and professional backgrounds predict their knowing another fighter, that network is\nmore likely to be naturally forming – or absent any external force (i.e., manipulation by ISIS\nrecruiters or pressure from law enforcement scrutiny).\nTo specifically study foreign fighters from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula, this study\nselected a 1,059 out of the 3,581 coded fighters in the entire sample based on two criteria:\n(1) The fighter either claimed _residence_ _in_ a European country (defined as European Union\nplus the United Kingdom) or in an Arabian Peninsula country.\n(2) The fighter _self-reported travel to_ a European country or an Arabian Peninsula country in\ntheir form.\n17 M. McPherson, L. Smith-Lovin, and J.M. Cook, “Birds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks,” _Annual_\n_Review of Sociology_ 271, no. 1 (2001): 415-44.\n8\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nThe reason why I include people who traveled to Europe or the Arabian Peninsula, rather\nthan just people who report living in that region, is to determine the extent to which fighters\nhave ‘transnational’ ties. If local ties did not matter, or if they mattered less than other factors,\nthen it is worth testing whether fighters met other fighters who traveled to their region. A total\nof 1,578 fighters were analyzed in this study: 519 fighters in the Europe sample and 1,059 in the\nArabian Peninsula sample (Please refer to the tables in Annex III and IV for a list of the\ngeographic origin of fighters in this study).\nFinally, I chose to compare fighters from the Arabian Peninsula and Europe because they\n10\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nI use three different analytical techniques to analyze the networks in this study. First, I\nuse _Gephi,_ a network analysis software, to collect and analyze descriptive network statistics. This\nincludes the average number of ties with other fighters each fighter has, and the network’s\n“degree density,” or the proportion of actual ties to total possible ones. [20] This approach will tell\nus which network of fighters, from Europe or the Arabian Peninsula, was more interconnected.\nSecond, I combine all three networks into a single network diagram. First, because\nfighters who had the same reference, facilitator, and arrived at the same place on the same day\nare most likely to know each other. But, second, because the number of fighters who are\nconnected across all three networks serves as a proxy indicator for the amount of freedom\nfighters to self-organize and mobilize. Fighters who join ISIS together in large numbers is\nanother signal, albeit imperfect, that they had greater freedom to mobilize. All other things being\nequal, for a high-risk activity, it is easier and more efficient to join in groups. [21] However, as we\nwill see, other considerations might prevent these networks from growing too large in size.\nThird, I will determine which characteristics of ISIS foreign fighters are most predictive\nof whether they share a tie with each other. To do this, I will use exponential random graph\nmodeling (ERGM), which is a statistical model that analyzes network structure and allows us to\nmake certain inferences about the attributes that predict whether two nodes share a tie. [22] The\nmain focus of this study is the extent to which a fighters’ geographic origin predicts his\nlikelihood of sharing a tie with another fighter. How likely is a fighter from Europe to be\nconnected to other fighters if they are from the same country? This ERGM analysis will also\ninclude other attributes, such as age, marital status, level of religious knowledge, foreign travel,\n20 Mathieu Bastian, Sebastian Heymann, and Mathieu Jacomy, “Gephi: an open source software for exploring and\nmanipulating networks.” (paper presented at the 3rd annual International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social\nMedia, San Jose, California, USA, April, 2009).\n21 Walter Enders and Xuejuan Su, “Rational Terrorists and Optimal Network Structure” _Journal of Conflict Resolution_\n51 no. 1 (2007): 33-57.\n22 Dean Lusher, Johan Koskinen, and Garry Robins, eds., _Exponential Random Graph Models for Social Networks_\n(Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, 2012); D.R.

Comparing Networks of ISIS Fighters from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula**\nThis section analyzes the interconnectedness of fighters in the Arabian Peninsula and\nEurope samples in two parts. First, it will compare the statistics of connectedness of each\nnetwork at different levels of degree restriction (denoted as ‘L’). This is to determine whether\nclusters of fighters from the two regions behave differently as they get larger. Second, it will\ncompare the strength of fighter ties in each network by identifying the fighters who share a tie\nacross all three networks. Overall, the diagrams in Figure 1 and the statistics in Table 3 show that\nthe Arabian Peninsula network is more interconnected than the fighters from Europe.\nTable 3 – Comparison of Descriptive Statistics in Europe and Arabian Peninsula Networks\n12\n|Col1|Reference Network|Col3|Facilitator Network|Col5|Entry Network|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Europe|Arab Penin|Europe|Arab Penin|Europe|Arab Penin|\n|**All Nodes:**|**All Nodes:**|**All Nodes:**|**All Nodes:**|**All Nodes:**|**All Nodes:**|**All Nodes:**|\n|Av.

There are three\nkey statistics that describe the difference in the connectedness of the networks in the two\nregions: the average weighted degree, the number of connected components, and the percentage\nof isolates or nodes with a degree greater than or equal to a certain value. The average weighted\ndegree is calculated by adding the number of edges for each node with consideration for their\nweight. For example, if a node has two edges, one weighted 1 and the other weighted 2, then it\nhas a weighted degree of 3. That is (1+0) for the first edge, plus (1+1) for the second edge. [23] The\nnumber of connected components is the number of groups of interconnected nodes in a graph\nthat include two or more connected nodes. The connected component statistic in Table 3 is not\nadjusted for the fact that the Arabian Peninsula has more than twice as many nodes (1059) as the\nEurope sample (519). Therefore, one would expect that the Arabian Peninsula sample would\nhave approximately twice as many connected components at each level of degree restriction. The\npercentage of isolates, or the percentage of nodes with a degree of 0, shows the distribution of\nnode connectivity.\nWhen including isolates, fighters from the Arabian Peninsula have nearly two times the\naverage weighted degree of the European fighters in the reference network. In the facilitator\nnetwork, the nodes in the Arabian Peninsula facilitator network have an almost 3.5 times larger\nweighted degree average than the European fighter sample, but the two regional networks\nconverge in terms of their connectivity when considering their entry networks. The explanation\nfor this convergence will be treated later in a sub-section of section IV titled “ISIS Managing\nEurope Fighter Arrivals.” It is also possible that the convergence for entry networks is because\n23 Borgatti et al (see note 27 above)\n14\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nthere is a limited number of people who can be transported on any given day through the\nsmuggling routes used to cross into Syria from Turkey. [24]\nThe number of connected components is larger for the Arabian Peninsula in all three\ngraphs than that of Europe. But this is not always more than double, which means that they have\nproportionately roughly the same number of connected components. In each of the networks,\nthe Arabian Peninsula sample has fewer isolates than the European sample; however, these\npercentages converge in the entry network.\nBy restricting the size of the network by degree (L) – first to nodes with an L greater than 0 (i.e.,\nnodes that have at least one tie with another) and then to nodes with a degree of 5 or greater\n(i.e., nodes that have at least five ties) – the differences between the Arabian Peninsula sample\nand the Europe sample remain relatively consistent. In the reference and facilitator networks, the\nArabian Peninsula sample is more interconnected: a larger percentage of its nodes have degrees\ngreater than 0 and 5 than those in Europe, and each one of those nodes generally has more ties,\nas evidenced by the larger average weighted degree. For the connected components, when L>0\nand L>4, the Arabian Peninsula sample has more than twice as many connected components,\nand, in the facilitator network, substantially more than twice the number of connected\ncomponents. This indicates that the nodes at higher degree levels are not just more connected,\nbut that there are more groupings of connections. However, the difference in network\ninterconnectedness between the regions in the entry networks remains negligible, even as the\ndegree level increases.\n24 Tim Arango and Eric Schmitt, “A Path to ISIS, Through a Porous Turkish Border,” _New York Times_, March 9,\n2015, https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/world/europe/despite-crackdown-path-to-join-isis-often-windsthrough-porous-turkish-border.html (accessed January 5, 2019).\n15\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\n**“Strong” Inferences - How Many Fighters Shared the Same Referral, Facilitator,**\n**and Arrived at the Same Place on the Same Day?**\nThis section will look at the number of fighters from Europe and the Arabian Peninsula who\nwere most likely to know each other – those who shared the same referral, facilitator, and who\n(Pr⁡(X⁡ = ⁡x|Y⁡ = ⁡y)⁡= (\n1\n𝑖<𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗(𝑦𝑖 +⁡𝑦𝑗) + 𝜃𝑏 ∑𝑖<𝑗 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑦𝑖𝑦𝑗⁡)\n𝑘 ~~[)]~~ [⁡exp⁡(𝜃][𝑇][𝑧(𝑥) +⁡𝜃][𝑎] [∑]\n25 Some fighters have an edge weight greater than three if they 1) share a tie in all three networks and 2) share\nmultiple answers in common to the same question (e.g., multiple references).\n26 Lusher et al (see note 31 above).\n17\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nWhere the conditional odds of the tie between nodes i and j is equal to the exponentiated\nsum of the coefficients θa and θb – the attributes shared by i and j - over the constant, while the\nexp⁡(𝜃 [𝑇] 𝑧(𝑥))⁡component is the conditional odds of a tie when the two nodes do not share any\nnot show a large number of these types of transnational ties.\n29 Fraihi (see note 5 above)\n22\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nFigure 4 – Hierarchy in Arabian Peninsula Fighters, Decentralized Networks in Europe\n## **Arabian** **Peninsula**\nThe second reason relates to network hierarchy. Network hierarchy suggests a freedom\nto organize: the large nodes in the Arabian Peninsula diagram are brokers between large\ncommunities of fighters. If linguistic commonalities were the main reason driving the differences\nbetween ISIS foreign fighter networks in Europe and the Arabian Peninsula, the hierarchy in the\n23\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nArabian Peninsula network would be less pronounced (shown in Figure 4). The network\ndiagrams show the structure of the main component of the entire network of fighters from\nEurope and the Arabian Peninsula. Whereas the Arabian Peninsula resembles a network where\nthere is some clear hierarchy among certain nodes which are far more central to the model\n(sometimes called a “scale-free” network). The central nodes in Figure 4 are highlighted by their\nsize – larger nodes possess greater “betweenness centrality” (they are critical nodes one would\nneed to travel through if one wanted to move across the network). That this hierarchy so clearly\nexists in the Arabian Peninsula network, as opposed to that from Europe, underscores the fact\nthat it was not just shared language in the Arabian Peninsula but, likely, a greater freedom to\nmobilize that contributed to how the network of foreign fighters formed. Linguistic\ncommonalities might account for the fact that there are a large number of ties between fighters,\nbut it cannot explain the hierarchical structure that appears among fighters who join from the\nArabian Peninsula. [30]\nThe third reason why shared language is unlikely to explain why European foreign\nfighters are more likely to be connected to each other by country than those from the Arabian\nPeninsula is that these same findings hold up when we zoom into specific countries. Appendix\nVI shows how fighters from France are much more likely to be connected to each other based\non where they come from inside France than those fighters from Saudi Arabia from within Saudi\nArabia. This finding serves as a “robustness” check that confirms the trends we found in\nsections III and IV.\nThese three factors: 1) the hierarchy of networks in the Arabian Peninsula, 2) the lack of\na transnational dimension in European networks, and 3) the fact that these trends also exist\ninside European countries – demonstrate that language and accessibility do not explain why\n30 Note: the network diagrams in Figure 4 combined the reference and date/location of entry networks. As\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, the facilitator network does not reflect fighters’ self-organizing is therefore excluded.\n24\nRosenblatt – Localism as Secrecy, 2020\nfighters in the Arabian Peninsula were freer to organize and mobilize. This inference would\nconfirm previous research on the secrecy-efficiency tradeoff of terrorist groups. Secret groups\nneed hub and spoke models of organizing, with decentralized networks that avoid detection or\ndisruption but cannot grow. More efficient organizational models, like scale-free, hierarchical\nnetworks, only form among members of an insurgent or covert group when they are freer to\norganize. [31]",
