  "introduction": "Researchers have long sought a reliable relationship between tree size and stand density for use in \nforest inventory and management. Eichhorn (1904) observed that wood volume correlates well \nwith stand height, and that this correlation is independent of stand age and site quality. However, \nthe relationship between volume and stand height is a curve that may depend on stand \nmanagement, restricting the utility of this relationship (Skovsgaard and Vanclay, 2008). \n \nOther relationships between mean tree size and stand density have been suggested, and many of \nthese can be generalised as lnN + β lnS = constant, where N is stand density (stems/ha) and S is \nsome measure of stem size (e.g., height, diameter or volume; Vanclay, 1994). For instance, Hart \n(1928; also Wilson, 1951) advocated relative spacing (N) which relates average spacing to top \nheight (H): lnN + 2lnH = constant; Reineke (1933) advocated a stand density index relating limiting \nstocking (N) to mean stem diameter (D ): lnN + 1.6ln D = constant; and Kira et al.",

  "methodology": "The relationship, D = β (H-1.3)/Ln(N) is a straight line passing through the origin and relates the \nmean diameter of forest trees (D, diameter at breast height, 1.3 m above ground) to the stand \nheight (H, average height of the largest trees in a stand) divided by the logarithm of stand density \n(N, number of trees per hectare). This one-parameter model is inherently robust and simple to \nestimate, and may be useful in data-scarce situations where established approaches cannot be \ncalibrated. Many researchers have examined the diameter-height-density relationship for \nindividual trees within stands (e.g., Curtis, 1967; Lynch et al., 2007; Mohler et al., 1978; Niklas et \nal., 2003; Rio et al., 2001; Temesgen and Gadow, 2004; Vanclay and Henry, 1988; Zeide, 1995; \nZeide and Vanderschaaf, 2002), but this particular relationship has apparently not been reported \npreviously. This relationship has been observed empirically for several sites and species, and is \nconsistent with expected natural stand dynamics. Stand height H reflects past performance and is \nextensively used as a measure of site (Skovsgaard and Vanclay, 2008), is correlated with both \ncrown width and root length (Hemery et al., 2005; Kajimoto et al., 2007; Niklas and Spatz, 2006; \nPeichl and Arain, 2007; Usoltsev and Vanclay, 1995) and thus reflects the resources potentially \navailable to a tree.",
  "results": "Figure 1 illustrates the relationship D = β (H-1.3)/Ln(N) for 626 measurements in 97 plots of \neven-aged Eucalyptus pilularis in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. The dotted line \nillustrates the average trend with β=5.6 (s.e.=0.026), while the individual plot estimates vary \nbetween 4.1 and 7.8. A straight line through the origin offers an adequate (P<0.001) and \nsufficient (test for lack of fit: P>0.06) fit to these data. The illustrated data span a range of density \n80-7180/ha, of mean diameter 2-67 cm, and of stand height 4-54 m, indicating the stability of the \nrelationship. These plots were established from 1931, span a time interval of up to 55 years, and \nwere measured up to 31 times during that period.",
  "discussion": "This relationship has apparently not been recognised previously, but appears to hold for a wide \nrange of species and conditions (Table 1). The one-parameter nature of this relationship makes it \neasy to calibrate, even when data are limiting. Empirical studies suggest that the slope β varies \nbetween 5 and 10 for different sites and species (Table 1). Species planted as polycultures appear \nto exhibit similar values for β (Fig. 8, Table 1), suggesting that β may be site-dependent rather \nthan species-dependent, but further research is warranted to confirm this observation.",
  "conclusion": "In even-aged stands, the mean diameter of forest trees (D, diameter at breast height, 1.3 m above \nground) tends to remain proportional to the stand height (H, average height of the largest trees in \na stand) divided by the logarithm of stand density (N, number of trees per hectare): d = β (H-\n1.3)/Ln(N). Thinning causes a relatively small and temporary perturbation to β, the magnitude \nand duration of which depends on the nature of the thinning. \n \n\n \nAcknowledgements \n \nMy colleagues David Lamb (University of Queensland, Australia), Jerry Leech (Woods and \nForests Department, South Australia), JP Skovsgaard (Danish Centre for Forest, Landscape and \nPlanning) and Vladimir Usoltsev (Forest Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences) kindly \nprovided data for use in this analysis.
