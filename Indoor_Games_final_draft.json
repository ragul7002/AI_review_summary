The reluctance of these companies to make data publicly available limits the wide use and development of data mining techniques and artificial intelligence research specific to the game industry. In this work, we developed and implemented an international competition on game data mining using commercial game log data from one of the major game companies in South Korea: NCSOFT. Our approach enabled researchers to develop and apply state-of-the-art data mining techniques to game log data by making the data open. Game artificial intelligence (AI) competition platforms help researchers access well-defined benchmarking problems to evaluate different algorithms, test new approaches, and educate students [1]. Since the early 2000s, considerable effort has focused on designing and running new game AI competitions using mathematical, board, video, and physical games [2]. Despite a few exceptions, most of",
